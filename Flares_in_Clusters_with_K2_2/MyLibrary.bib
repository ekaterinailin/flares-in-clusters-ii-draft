        survey for stellar companions to 1120 M dwarf primaries known to
        lie within 25 pc of the Sun via trigonometric parallaxes. In
        addition to a comprehensive literature search, stars were
        explored in new surveys for companions at separations of
        2″-300″. A reconnaissance of wide companions to separations of
        300″ was done via blinking archival images. I-band images were
        used to search our sample for companions at separations of
        2″-180″. Various astrometric and photometric methods were used
        to probe the inner 2″ to reveal close companions. We report the
        discovery of 20 new companions and identify 56 candidate
        multiple systems. We find a stellar multiplicity rate of 26.8
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.4\% and a stellar companion rate of 32.4
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.4\% for M dwarfs. There is a broad peak in
        the separation distribution of the companions at 4-20 au, with a
        weak trend of smaller projected linear separations for lower
        mass primaries. A hint that M-dwarf multiplicity may be a
        function of tangential velocity is found, with faster moving,
        presumably older, stars found to be multiple somewhat less
        often. We calculate that stellar companions make up at least
        17\% of mass attributed to M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood,
        with roughly 11\% of M-dwarf mass hidden as unresolved
        companions. Finally, when considering all M-dwarf primaries and
        companions, we find that the mass distribution for M dwarfs
        increases to the end of the stellar main sequence.}",

        their habitability, but might also trigger the genesis of life
        around small stars. TESS provides a new sample of bright dwarf
        stars in our galactic neighborhood, collecting data for
        thousands of M dwarfs that might host habitable exoplanets.
        Here, we use an automated search for flares accompanied by
        visual inspection. Then, our public allesfitter code robustly
        selects the appropriate model for potentially complex flares via
        Bayesian evidence. We identify 1228 flaring stars, 673 of which
        are M dwarfs. Among 8695 flares in total, the largest superflare
        increased the stellar brightness by a factor of 16.1. Bolometric
        flare energies range from 10$^{31.0}$ to 10$^{36.9}$ erg, with a
        median of 10$^{33.1}$ erg. Furthermore, we study the flare rate
        and energy as a function of stellar type and rotation period. We
        solidify past findings that fast rotating M dwarfs are the most
        likely to flare and that their flare amplitude is independent of
        the rotation period. Finally, we link our results to criteria
        for prebiotic chemistry, atmospheric loss through coronal mass
        ejections, and ozone sterilization. Four of our flaring M dwarfs
        host exoplanet candidates alerted on by TESS, for which we
        discuss how these effects can impact life. With upcoming TESS

        estimator for solar-type dwarfs, existing activity-age relations
        produce implausible ages at both high and low activity levels.
        We have compiled R$^{'}$$_{HK}$ data from the literature for
        young stellar clusters, richly populating for the first time the
        young end of the activity-age relation. Combining the cluster
        activity data with modern cluster age estimates and analyzing
        the color dependence of the chromospheric activity age index, we
        derive an improved activity-age calibration for F7-K2 dwarfs
        (0.5 mag \&lt; B - V \&lt; 0.9 mag ). We also present a more
        fundamentally motivated activity-age calibration that relies on
        conversion of R$^{'}$$_{HK}$ values through the Rossby number to
        rotation periods and then makes use of improved gyrochronology

        ages through activity-rotation-age relations accounts for some
        color-dependent effects and systematically improves the age
        estimates (albeit only slightly). We demonstrate that coronal
        activity as measured through the fractional X-ray luminosity
        (R$_{X}$ = L$_{X}$/L$_{bol}$) has nearly the same age- and
        rotation-inferring capability as chromospheric activity measured
        through R$^{'}$$_{HK}$. As a first application of our

We derive linear radii, effective temperatures, and absolute luminosities of the stars using Hipparcos parallaxes and measured bolometric fluxes. The new data are combined with previously published values to create an Angular Diameter Anthology of measured angular diameters to main-sequence stars (luminosity classes V and IV). This compilation consists of 125 stars with diameter uncertainties of less than 5\%, ranging in spectral types from A to M. The large quantity of empirical data is used to derive color-temperature relations to an assortment of color indices in the Johnson (BVR {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} I {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} JHK), Cousins (R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}C{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} I {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}C{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), Kron (R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}K{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} I {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}K{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), Sloan (griz), and WISE (W {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} W {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) photometric systems. These relations have an average standard deviation of {\textasciitilde}3\% and are valid for stars with spectral types A0-M4. To derive even more accurate relations for Sun-like stars, we also determined these temperature relations omitting early-type stars (T {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 6750 K) that may have biased luminosity estimates because of rapid rotation; for this subset the dispersion is only {\textasciitilde}2.5\%. We find effective temperatures in agreement within a couple of percent for the interferometrically characterized sample of main-sequence stars compared to those derived via the infrared flux method and spectroscopic analysis.},

        the power-law index of the flare frequency distribution as a
        function of energy (dN/dE vprop E $^{-{\ensuremath{\gamma}}}$)
        between 5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{34}$ and {}10$^{36}$ erg is on
        average {\ensuremath{\gamma}} = 2.04 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.17,
        which is in agreement with previous results. The
        {\ensuremath{\gamma}} values of eight stars with frequent
        flaring activity vary between 1.59 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06 and
        2.11 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.19, suggesting a possible diversity of
        energy release effects. In general, stars with shorter rotation
        periods tend to have larger {\ensuremath{\gamma}} values. There
        is an indication that the flare energy is saturated at about 2
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{37}$ erg. For a few large superflares of
        this energy range, it is found that their temporal behaviors
        could be characterized by a transition from single impulsive
        flares to long-duration flares composed of several flares.}",

  abstract = {In an effort to examine the relationship between flare flux and corresponding CME mass, we temporally and spatially correlate all X-ray flares and CMEs in the LASCO and GOES archives from 1996 to 2006. We cross-reference 6733 CMEs having well-measured masses against 12thinspace050 X-ray flares having position information as determined from their optical counterparts. For a given flare, we search in time for CMEs which occur 10thinspace--thinspace80~minutes afterward, and we further require the flare and CME to occur within textpmthinspace45$^\circ$ in position angle on the solar disk. There are 826 CME/flare pairs which fit these criteria. Comparing the flare fluxes with CME masses of these paired events, we find CME mass increases with flare flux, following an approximately log-linear, broken relationship: in the limit of lower flare fluxes, logthinspace(CME mass)$\propto$0.68\texttimes{}logthinspace(flare flux), and in the limit of higher flare fluxes, logthinspace(CME mass)$\propto$0.33\texttimes{}logthinspace(flare flux). We show that this broken power-law, and in particular the flatter slope at higher flare fluxes, may be due to an observational bias against CMEs associated with the most energetic flares: halo CMEs. Correcting for this bias yields a single power-law relationship of the form logthinspace(CME mass)$\propto$0.70\texttimes{}logthinspace(flare flux). This function describes the relationship between CME mass and flare flux over at least 3~dex in flare flux, from $\approx$thinspace10-7thinspace--thinspace10-4~Wthinspacem-2.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the active dM4e star GJ 1243. We use previous observations and
ground-based echelle spectroscopy to determine that GJ 1243 is a member of the Argus association
of field stars, suggesting it is $\sim$ 30 - 50 Myr old. We analyze eleven months of 1-minute cadence
data from Kepler, presenting Kepler flare frequency distributions, as well as determining correlations
between flare energy, amplitude, duration, and decay time. We find that the exponent $\alpha$ of the
power-law flare energy distribution varies in time, primarily due to completeness of sample and the
low frequency of high-energy flares. We also find a deviation from a single power law at high energy.
We use ground-based spectroscopic observations simultaneous with the Kepler data to provide si-
multaneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of three low-energy flares, the lowest-energy dMe
flares with detailed spectral analysis to date on any star. The spectroscopic data from these flares
extend constraints for radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) flare models to a lower energy regime than has
previously been studied. We use this simultaneous spectroscopy and Kepler photometry to develop
approximate conversions from the Kepler bandpass to the traditional U and B bands. This conversion
will be a critical factor in comparing any Kepler flare analyses to the canon of previous ground-based
flare studies.},

  abstract = {This work reviews factors which are important for the evolution of habitable Earth-like planets such as the effects of the host star dependent radiation and particle fluxes on the evolution of atmospheres and initial water inventories. We discuss the geodynamical and geophysical environments which are necessary for planets where plate tectonics remain active over geological time scales and for planets which evolve to one-plate planets. The discoveries of methane--ethane surface lakes on Saturn's large moon Titan, subsurface water oceans or reservoirs inside the moons of Solar System gas giants such as Europa, Ganymede, Titan and Enceladus and more than 335 exoplanets, indicate that the classical definition of the habitable zone concept neglects more exotic habitats and may fail to be adequate for stars which are different from our Sun. A classification of four habitat types is proposed. Class I habitats represent bodies on which stellar and geophysical conditions allow Earth-analog planets to evolve so that complex multi-cellular life forms may originate. Class II habitats includes bodies on which life may evolve but due to stellar and geophysical conditions that are different from the class I habitats, the planets rather evolve toward Venus- or Mars-type worlds where complex life-forms may not develop. Class III habitats are planetary bodies where subsurface water oceans exist which interact directly with a silicate-rich core, while class IV habitats have liquid water layers between two ice layers, or liquids above ice. Furthermore, we discuss from the present viewpoint how life may have originated on early Earth, the possibilities that life may evolve on such Earth-like bodies and how future space missions may discover manifestations of extraterrestrial life.},

observing night, results of the post-reduction analysis, like radial velocity
and stellar parameters, along with the reduced spectra are inserted into the
database. This database, with information spanning from how often a tar-
get is picked, when it has been successfully acquired, how big were the

Magnetic activity in the sample of FGKM stars shows a linear-type relation for the magnetic activity- rotation relation, supporting Weber and Davis '67 linear dynamo theory
different saturation regimes (single and bimodal) are found for different Stokes-vectors
Stokes I Zeeman Broadening~ (ZB) traces all magnetic field strength, small scale (not permeating the solar wind) and large scale strength
Stokes V Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) technique traces the large scale field strength and topology
ZB works better for slow rotation (fast rotation broadens lines, too)
ZDI works better for fast rotating stars
Finding: Large and small scale fields are coupled.
The activity relation is a complex function age, mass and rotation
hot jupiters do not seem to affect the stellar magnetism, possible reasons

tides in the system are too weak to have any effect
even if it was the case earlier the stellar dynamo might have wiped out the effect by now

Magnetochronology would not be more precise than gyrochronology or other curently used methods.

	abstract = {Context. {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Messier 35{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} ({\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}NGC 2168{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}) is an important young nearby cluster. Its age, richness and relative proximity make it an ideal target for stellar evolution studies. The Kepler K2 mission recently observed it and provided a high accuracy photometric time series of a large number of sources in this area of the sky. Identifying the cluster's members is therefore of high importance to optimize the interpretation and analysis of the Kepler K2 data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to identify the cluster's members by deriving membership probabilities for the sources within 1° of the cluster's center, which is farther away than equivalent previous studies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We measure accurate proper motions and multiwavelength (optical and near-infrared) photometry using ground-based archival images of the cluster. We use these measurements to compute membership probabilities. The list of candidate members from the literature is used as a training set to identify the cluster's locus in a multidimensional space made of proper motions, luminosities, and colors. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The final catalog includes 338 892 sources with multiwavelength photometry. Approximately half (194 452) were detected at more than two epochs and we measured their proper motion and used it to derive membership probability. A total of 4349 candidate members with membership probabilities greater than 50\% are found in this sample in the luminosity range between 10 mag and 22 mag. The slow proper motion of the cluster and the overlap of its sequence with the field and background sequences in almost all color-magnitude and color-color diagrams complicate the analysis and the contamination level is expected to be significant. Our study, nevertheless, provides a coherent and quantitative membership analysis of Messier 35 based on a large fraction of the best ground-based data sets obtained over the past 18 years. As such, it represents a valuable input for follow-up studies using, in particular, the Kepler K2 photometric time series.

        project in existence to scan the entire sky in optical light
        approximately every day, reaching a depth of g
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 18 mag. Over the course of its first 4 yr of
        transient alerts (2013-2016), ASAS-SN observed 53 events
        classified as likely M dwarf flares. We present follow-up
        photometry and spectroscopy of all 53 candidates, confirming
        flare events on 47 M dwarfs, one K dwarf, and one L dwarf. The
        remaining four objects include a previously identified T Tauri
        star, a young star with outbursts, and two objects too faint to
        confirm. A detailed examination of the 49 flare star light
        curves revealed an additional six flares on five stars,
        resulting in a total of 55 flares on 49 objects ranging in
        V-band contrast from {\ensuremath{\Delta}}V = -1 to -10.2 mag.
        Using an empirical flare model to estimate the unobserved
        portions of the flare light curve, we obtain lower limits on the
        V-band energy emitted during each flare, spanning
        \{log\}(\{E\}$_{V}$/\{erg\})=32-35, which are among the most
        energetic flares detected on M dwarfs. The ASAS-SN M dwarf flare
        stars show a higher fraction of H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission,
        as well as stronger H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, compared to
        M dwarfs selected without reference to activity, consistent with
        belonging to a population of more magnetically active stars. We
        also examined the distribution of tangential velocities, finding
        that the ASAS-SN flaring M dwarfs are likely to be members of
        the thin disk and are neither particularly young nor old.}",

  title = {Kinetic Studies and Effects of Anions on Creatine Phosphokinase from Skeletal Muscle of Rhesus Monkey ({{Macaca}} Mulatta)},
  volume = {410},
  issn = {0006-3002},
  abstract = {A purification procedure for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) from muscle of the monke35--170 muequiv H+/mg protein per min at 30 degrees C and a yield of approx. 0.5 g/kg muscle. Assuming equilibrium kinetics, synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions. Kinetic constants for the binding of each substrate to the free enzyme and the enzyme-second substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for the enzyme from other species. Inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products. SO4(2-) inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group. Inhibition by NO3-, NO2-, SCN- and Cl- is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar transition-state complex. These anions stabilize the dead-end complex, enzyme-creatine-MgADP, which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group. The effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis. The dead-end complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group against inhibition by iodoacetamide. Addition of NO3- or Cl- to the dead-end complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection. The essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is essentially independent of pH over the normal stability range of the enzyme. Contrary to our previous report this pH independence is not altered by the presence of dead-end complex, creatine plus MgADP, in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture. It is inferred that the 'essential' thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same properties as that of the rabbit enzyme. In consequence, the inferences made about the role of this group based on our previous work on the monkey enzyme are no longer valid. The present findings are compatible with the essential thiol group playing a conformational role in the catalytic process.},

Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we discovered a planet orbiting the ~20 Myr-old star 51 Eridani at a projected separation of 13 astronomical units. Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with strong methane and water vapor absorption. Modeling of the spectra and photometry yields a luminosity of L/L$\circledbullet$=1.6-4.0 \texttimes{} 10-6 and an effective temperature of 600-750 K. For this age and luminosity, ``hot-start'' formation models indicate a mass twice that of Jupiter. This planet also has a sufficiently low luminosity to be consistent with the ``cold-start'' core accretion process that may have formed Jupiter.},

  abstract = {The Sun, stars similar to it, and many rather dissimilar to it, have chromospheres, regions classically viewed as lying above the brilliant photosphere and characterized by a positive temperature gradient and a marked departure from radiative equilibrium. Stellar chromospheres exhibit a wide range of phenomena collectively called activity, stemming largely from the time evolution of their magnetic fields and the mass flux and transfer of radiation through the complex magnetic topology and the increasingly optically thin plasma of the outer stellar atmosphere. In this review, I will (1) outline the development of our understanding of chromospheric structure from 1960 to the present, (2) discuss the major observational programs and theoretical lines of inquiry, (3) review the origin and nature of both solar and stellar chromospheric activity and its relationship to, and effect on, stellar parameters including total energy output, and (4) summarize the outstanding problems today.},

  annote = {Chromosphere basics:

chromospheres work as cooling agents as long there are elements to ionize and lines to excite, i.e. a relatively cool photosphere is present
chromospheres are defined largely by their activity, i.e. the~ energy dumped into the region causing ionization and excitation by convective and/or magnetic processes

Key points:

mass, metallicity and rotation determine the properties of an atmosphere. Its observed measures therefore point to the basic parameters of a star.
even fully convective dwarfs show chromospheric activity, indicating that a tachocline is no necessary component for a functional stellar dynamo.
Motivation for chromosphere research:

broader understanding of the operation of stellar dynamos
solar-stellar connection
interest in effects on planetary climates (Earth and elsewhere, see Maunder Minimum, habitability etc.)

RED GIANTS: magnetic nature that drives chromospheric activity on the Sun is retained by stars well past the end of their MS lives (giants can have coronae or wind emitting the excess mechanical energy OR both, caled hybrid types)
Preston-Vaughan gap: Lack of intermediate S-index stars in F-G spectrum. Suggested explanation: Switching of the dynamo process from multi-mode with short cycles to single-mode with longer cycles. The Sun falls into the gap!
Basal chromosphere: There is a lower level to chromospheric activity that is independent of coronal activity, though even this one is patchy. Possible origins are acoustic waves and small-scale turbulent magnetic fields (multiscale magnetic carpet).
Solar problem: The chromospheric variability is high but the photospheric one is rather low, which was found only in one solar twin so far. FIND MORE EFFIN SOLAR TWINS.

Anecdotes:

the mass of the solar chromosphere is only about the mass of Earth's atmosphere

Impulsiveness of a flare:
Quantitatively sorts flares according to their light curve properties, i.e. peak intensity (here: UV) and t\_1/2:Imp=I\_peak/t\_1/2
Classifying flares by impulsiveness one finds that the peak black body temperature depends on Imp:

Impulsive flares: T=10-14 kK (Imp$>$1)
Hybrid flares: T=9.5-12 kK (Imp\textasciitilde{}1 but shows a prominent impulsive phase)
Gradual flares: T\textasciitilde{}9kK (Imp$<$1)

Balmer emission contribution:
Balmer emission is ubiquitous in flare spectra: BaC makes up 20-80\% of near UV flux and 11-17\% of total emission in the [3400;5200]A band.
Final remarks:

The info on large flares is limited due to the sample of 20 flares in total on dMe stars.

  abstract = {The light curves of solar-type stars present both periodic fluctuation and flare spikes. The gradual periodic fluctuation is interpreted as the rotational modulation of magnetic features on the stellar surface and is used to deduce magnetic feature activity properties. The flare spikes in light curves are used to derive flare activity properties. In this paper, we analyze the light curve data of three solar-type stars (KIC 6034120, KIC 3118883, and KIC 10528093) observed with Kepler space telescope and investigate the relationship between their magnetic feature activities and flare activities. The analysis shows that: (1) both the magnetic feature activity and the flare activity exhibit long-term variations as the Sun does; (2) unlike the Sun, the long-term variations of magnetic feature activity and flare activity are not in phase with each other; (3) the analysis of star KIC 6034120 suggests that the long-term variations of magnetic feature activity and flare activity have a similar cycle length. Our analysis and results indicate that the magnetic features that dominate rotational modulation and the flares possibly have different source regions, although they may be influenced by the magnetic field generated through a same dynamo process.},

  volume = {478},
  abstract = {We report the discovery of a high-temperature source above the soft X-ray loop of the impulsive limb flare on 1992 January 13 with the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT). The hot source coincides in position with the loop-top impulsive hard X-ray source and continues to sit above the soft X-ray flare loop throughout the flare. The single high-temperature source in the initial phase evolves to the two high-temperature (15-20 MK) ridge structures in the peak and decay phases, and the compact hard X-ray source appears to be located in between the high-temperature ridges. We assume that the loop-top hard X-ray source is of thermal origin (superhot source). The loop-top hard X-ray source has an effective temperature of 100-150 MK and a total emission measure of ~10 -4 of the hot source. The geometrical relationship between the superhot and the hot sources indicates that (1) the hot source is heated by the slow shocks associated with magnetic reconnection and that (2) the superhot source is heated with the fast bow shock owing to the collision of the supersonic downward outflow with the reconnected flux tube. The small emission measure of the superhot source indicates a narrow outflow jet in between the slow shocks. These observations suggest that there is no essential difference between the compact-loop (impulsive) and long-duration event (LDE) flares. The time coincidence of the loop-top hard X-ray source with the footpoint sources indicates that nonthermal electron acceleration is causally related to the formation of the fast shock rather than the slow shocks.},

  pages = {876--890},
  annote = {Key question: How reliable is the extrapolation for the mass lass from CMEs from the Sun to stars that are much younger and also much more active?
Key points overall:

Empirical model relating stellar flare rates with solar flare\textendash{}CME relationships to estimate the CME occurrence rates and associated mass-loss on active stars
The solar flare\textendash{}CME association rate is the most uncertain component:

CMEs may only occur under certain conditions of the overlying magnetic field, coronal confinement and the large scle field may hinder mass loss.

Strong dependence of the model on flare power law index.
Need:

more direct observations of CMEs on active young stars
progress in modeling active region magnetic fields on stars with different global magnetic field topologies and strengths.
FFDs for large energy ranges!

Key points from the intro:

planets in the HZ of M dwarfs are likely to be tidally locked, leading to a weak magnetic moment, making them susceptible to impacts from flares and CMEs which are closer by than in Sun-like stars.
Efficient polar winds could be generated if the atmospheres are highly ionized by the stellar XUV flux.
If CMEs are accompanied by flares or vice versa both are typically strong, if they occur individually they tend to be weak.
However, there's evidence that non-flaring CMEs are rather an artifact due to observational limitations.

CME crash course:

Frequently encountered: three-part structure consisting of a bright core, a dark cavity and a narrow, bright leading edge. Cores = eruptive prominences (EPs).
The occurrence rate of solar CMEs varies in the course of the solar cycle from about one every few days in minimum to a few per day in maximum.
The associated mass-loss rate ranges from about 1.5 to 4.8\texttimes{}10\^-16 M/yr from minimum to maximum,~ i.e. a few \% of the average mass-loss rate from the solar wind ($\sim$2\texttimes{}10\^-14 M/yr). CME masses can be up to several 10\^16 g, whereas their velocities range from a few 100 to a few 1000 km/s.

How to detect CMEs on stars:

as transient blue-shifted emission components in spectral lines during flares
transient absorptions seen in UV or X-rays, indicating excess neutralmaterial rising above the flaring region and obscuring the emission
as associated with stellar prominences, observed as transient features in the broadened Balmer line profiles of fast rotating young stars
as radio type II bursts, which are related to propagating shock fronts and are therefore often associated with CMEs on the Sun (not observed yet)

CME-flare relation approaches:

Upper limits more important for overall mass loss estimates. Max. flare energy related to maximum CME mass.
Rough estimate of the maximum CME mass: Equating the maximum flare energies derived above with the kinetic energy of the CME and assuming a velocity comparable to the stellar escape velocity.
Speculation: It is possible that the flare\textendash{}CME association rate shifts to higher flare energies, meaning that it could have a similar functional form as on the Sun, but the flare energy where the association becomes about 100 per cent is much higher.
Accepted picture on the Sun: for almost constant conditions of the overlying field, the eruptiveness of a potential CME mainly depends on flare energy.
The role of confinement:

Increased differential rotation leads to higher non-potentialityof the corona; such stars may eject more CMEs. Differential rotation increases with stellar T\_eff $>>>$ Sun-like stars eject more CMEs than M dwarfs

  volume = {413},
  issn = {0006-3002},
  abstract = {The (Na+ +K+)-activated, Mg2+-dependent ATPase from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated, soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids, using deoxycholate. This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM. Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively. The ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol. The cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below. Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km values for ATP. Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in this context.},

  abstract = {During the last centuries historic observations revealed the magnetic activity of the sun. The large-scaled poloidal magnetic field reverses during a cycle of about 11 years. Especially during the maximum of particular cycles, dark sunspots can occur on the solar surface, which can store a huge amount of magnetic energy. If magnetic reconnection happens in the solar atmosphere, strong explosions and eruptions of material can be generated, which are called Flares. It is of special interest to study numerous stars with properties similar to the sun to draw meaningful statistics on flares in high energy ranges. In previous studies the first 120 d and 500 d of Kepler-data have been investigated (Maehara u. a., 2012; Shibayama u. a., 2013). It could be shown, that sun-like stars are able to create flares which are one to six orders of magnitude larger than the strongest events on the sun (called superflares). These results provide a challenge for theorists working on hydrodynamical dynamo-models of partly convective stars with spectral type similar to the sun. This thesis presents a data analysis for the full data-set of Kepler-observations (observation time span 3,4 yr). A special aim of this work is to estimate an absolute and relative superflare frequency for sun-like Kepler-stars and to compare these results with the sun. Results of a rough reinvestigation of several so far known sun-like superflare stars are presented which turn out the necessity for a more detailed analysis strategy. A key aspect of the improved data analysis is to minimize the false alarm probability. Using the sample of sun-like stars within the Kepler field of view, a relative superflare frequency of one event per 100 yr for superflares with energies up to 1034 erg was estimated which is more than one order of magnitude larger than in previous studies.},

GJ 1243 shows a differential rotation so slow that it suits a constraint for dynamo models that rely on differential rotation as an engine to the magnetic field. But is it even needed in fully convective M dwarfs? The threshold for diff. rot. may even turn out to be 0.
Challenges for the starspot models:

There exists a well known degeneracy between spot latitude and radius, resulting in families of solutions for spots at a given longitude but a range of latitudes and spot sizes that provide equally good fits to the observed light curve.

        rotation periods of main-sequence stars below 6500 K. Our
        automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods
        between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-
        sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and
        Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of
        stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the
        detailed features of the now well-populated period-temperature
        distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first
        seen by McQuillan et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to
        higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M $_{☉}$. We show
        that these results are globally consistent with the existing
        ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper
        envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a
        gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of
        Barnes, Mamajek, \&amp; Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also
        performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of
        Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation
        periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the
        amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection
        rotation periods, and found a typical range between
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde950 ppm (5th percentile) and
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde22,700 ppm (95th percentile),
        with a median of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5600 ppm. We
        found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower
        effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars
        above \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5400 K.}",

Here, we use observations from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) to show that superflare stars are generally characterized by larger chromospheric emissions than other stars, including the Sun. However, superflare stars with activity levels lower than, or comparable to, the Sun do exist, suggesting that solar flares and superflares most likely share the same origin. The very large ensemble of solar-like stars included in this study enables detailed and robust estimates of the relation between chromospheric activity and the occurrence of superflares.
~
Possible reasons for superflares:
(i) star\textendash{}star interactions, as is the case for RS CVn systems, where a close binary companion tidally spins up an F or G main-sequence star. It has been suggested that this tidal interaction can be accompanied by large co-rotating flux tubes that temporarily may connect the two stars and thus cause superflares when the interconnecting field lines subsequently disrupt;
(ii) star\textendash{}disk interactions, where the dipole magnetic field of the central star is connected to the co-rotating disk. The twist imposed on the dipole magnetic field can thus lead to disruption and superflares;
(iii) star\textendash{}planet interactions, which can take place in two different ways, either similar to the star\textendash{}star mechanism through disruption of interconnecting field lines or through tidal interaction between the star and the planet, which can lead to enhanced dynamo action and thus greater magnetic reconnection events.},

  abstract = {This review surveys the statistics of solar X-ray flares, emphasising the new views that RHESSI has given us of the weaker events (the microflares). The new data reveal that these microflares strongly resemble more energetic events in most respects; they occur solely within active regions and exhibit high-temperature/nonthermal emissions in approximately the same proportion as major events. We discuss the distributions of flare parameters (e.g., peak flux) and how these parameters correlate, for instance via the Neupert effect. We also highlight the systematic biases involved in intercomparing data representing many decades of event magnitude. The intermittency of the flare/microflare occurrence, both in space and in time, argues that these discrete events do not explain general coronal heating, either in active regions or in the quiet Sun.},

  abstract = {Optical flares on early F- and A-type stars have never been observed with certainty. Inspection
of several thousands of these stars in the Kepler public archives resulted in the discovery of
flares in 25 G-type and 27 F-type stars. Because A-type stars are thought not to be active, the
detection of flares on 19 A-type stars from a sample of nearly 2000 A stars is particularly
noteworthy. The flares have relative intensities in the range 1\textendash{}100 parts per thousand and
typical durations of a few minutes to several hours. The mean interval between flares varies
between 1 and 120 days. We estimate the typical energy of flares to be around 10 35 erg in the
F-type stars and about 10 36 erg in the A-type stars. Nearly all these stars vary at a low level
with a period which is most likely the rotational period of the star. Comparison of the relative
flare intensities with those in cool red stars observed by Kepler shows that flares in these stars,
and certainly in the A-type stars, cannot easily be ascribed to cool flare-star companions. The
huge energy released in the flares is difficult to understand. This is especially the case for
A-type stars since these stars are thought to have very weak magnetic fields. The flare energy
may possibly originate in magnetic reconnection of field lines between the primary star and a
companion.},

A-type stars do flare, at least 1\% of them!
But by what mechanism?
Literature review:

Typical solar flares have energies of about 10 29 erg, while the most energetic solar flares are about 10 31 erg. The superflares are estimated to have energies in the range 10 35 \textendash{}10 39 erg. Such a large release of energy is difficult to understand. Rubenstein \& Schaefer (2000) suggest that superflares may be caused by magnetic reconnection in magnetic field lines connecting the star with a planet.

X-ray flaring emission in early B-type stars probably arises from shocks and instabilities in their radiatively driven winds. [...] The overall X-ray detection rate among these stars is around 10\textendash{}15 per cent, which is indeed quite low (Schr{\"o}der \& Schmitt 2007), but not negligible. The detection rate increases steeply for F-type stars.
Solar white-light flares (WLFs) are a rare type of flare that results in an increase in the optical continuum or integrated light. Kretzschmar (2011) has presented evidence that all flares are WLFs and that the white-light continuum is the main contributor to the total radiated energy of the flare.

~
Origin of flares in A-F stars:

Indeed, it is generally assumed that X-ray flares in A\textendash{}F stars originate in a cool companion unless there is evidence to the contrary. One can reasonably assume that flare intensities on the cool companion are the same as in field stars of the same spectral type. Therefore, the relative flare intensities in the combined light of the two stars should be smaller than in isolated field stars. [...] We note, in fact, that the relative flare intensities for single K\textendash{}M stars is much the same as for the A\textendash{}F stars. There is no decrease of flare intensities as might be expected if the flares originate in cool companions. [...] If flares originate in cool companions, then these flares must be about 30\textendash{}100 times more intense than in cool flare stars in the general field. We do not know of any physical reason why this should be the case and we conclude that flares in F-type, and certainly in A-type stars cannot originate on cool companions.
The idea that flares are caused by magnetic reconnection is reasonable because this is the mechanism thought responsible for solar flares. However, other mechanisms are possible, such as the release of kinetic energy by infalling bodies. [...]~The typical interval between flares is a few tens of days. For an infalling body with mass 10 22 g, one impact every 20 days for a million years translates into 100 000 times the mass of our Solar system's asteroid belt. This mass is far too large to be acceptable.
One possibility is that flare energy originates in magnetic reconnection of field lines spanning the A star and a companion.

"Whatever the correct explanation may turn out to be, these stars certainly deserve further attention."-$>$ No solution yet there.

We have conducted a radial velocity survey of astrometric candidates with Lick, Palomar, and MMT observatories and have identified over 100 members, including 5 blue stragglers, 11 red giants, and 5 double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s). We estimate the cluster metallicity from spectroscopic analysis, using Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME), and find it to be [M/H] = +0.07 $\pm$ 0.03. We have obtained deep CFHT/MegaCam g ' r ' i ' z ' photometry and fit Padova isochrones to the ( g ' \textendash{} i ') and Two Micron All Sky Survey ( J \textendash{} K S ) color-magnitude diagrams, using the $\tau$ 2 maximum-likelihood procedure of Naylor, and an alternative method using two-dimensional cross-correlations developed in this work. We find best fits for Padova isochrones at age t = 2.5 $\pm$ 0.25 Gyr, m \textendash{} M = 7.35 $\pm$ 0.1, and A V = 0.25 $\pm$ 0.05, with additional uncertainty from the unresolved binary population and possibility of differential extinction across this large cluster. The inferred age is heavily dependent on our choice of stellar evolution model: fitting Dartmouth and PARSEC models yield age parameters of 3~Gyr and 3.25~Gyr, respectively. At ~300~pc and ~3~Gyr, Ruprecht 147 is by far the oldest nearby star cluster.},

Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we discovered a planet orbiting the 20 Myr-old star 51 Eridani at a projected separation of 13 astronomical units. Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with strong methane and water vapor absorption. Modeling of the spectra and photometry yields a luminosity of L/L$\circledbullet$=1.6-4.0 \texttimes{} 10-6 and an effective temperature of 600-750 K. For this age and luminosity, ``hot-start'' formation models indicate a mass twice that of Jupiter. This planet also has a sufficiently low luminosity to be consistent with the ``cold-start'' core accretion process that may have formed Jupiter.},

  abstract = {We report on radiative hydrodynamic simulations of moderate and strong solar flares. The flares were simulated by calculating the atmospheric response to a beam of nonthermal electrons injected at the apex of a one-dimensional closed coronal loop and include heating from thermal soft X-ray, extreme ultraviolet, and ultraviolet (XEUV) emission. The equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium were treated in non-LTE and solved for numerous transitions of hydrogen, helium, and Ca II, allowing the calculation of detailed line profiles and continuum emission. This work improves on previous simulations by incorporating more realistic nonthermal electron beam models and includes a more rigorous model of thermal XEUV heating. We find that XEUV back-warming contributes less than 10\% of the heating, even in strong flares. The simulations show elevated coronal and transition region densities resulting in dramatic increases in line and continuum emission in both the UV and optical regions. The optical continuum reaches a peak increase of several percent, which is consistent with enhancements observed in solar white-light flares. For a moderate flare (\textasciitilde{}M class), the dynamics are characterized by a long gentle phase of near balance between flare heating and radiative cooling, followed by an explosive phase with beam heating dominating over cooling and characterized by strong hydrodynamic waves. For a strong flare (\textasciitilde{}X class), the gentle phase is much shorter, and we speculate that for even stronger flares the gentle phase may be essentially nonexistent. During the explosive phase, synthetic profiles for lines formed in the upper chromosphere and transition region show blueshifts corresponding to a plasma velocity of \textasciitilde{}120 km s-1, and lines formed in the lower chromosphere show redshifts of \textasciitilde{}40 km s-1.},

  volume = {774},
  abstract = {We present the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of the old 8.2~Gyr solar twin, HIP 102152. We derive differential abundances of 21 elements relative to the Sun with precisions as high as 0.004 dex ( IMG [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim 1percent), using ultra high-resolution ( R = 110,000), high S/N UVES spectra obtained on the 8.2~m Very Large Telescope. Our determined metallicity of HIP 102152 is [Fe/H] = \textendash{}0.013 $\pm$ 0.004. The atmospheric parameters of the star were determined to be 54~K cooler than the Sun, 0.09 dex lower in surface gravity, and a microturbulence identical to our derived solar value. Elemental abundance ratios examined versus dust condensation temperature reveal a solar abundance pattern for this star, in contrast to most solar twins. The abundance pattern of HIP 102152 appears to be the most similar to solar of any known solar twin. Abundances of the younger, 2.9~Gyr solar twin, 18~Sco, were also determined from UVES spectra to serve as a comparison for HIP 102152. The solar chemical pattern of HIP 102152 makes it a potential candidate to host terrestrial planets, which is reinforced by the lack of giant planets in its terrestrial planet region. The following non-local thermodynamic equilibrium Li abundances were obtained for HIP 102152, 18~Sco, and the Sun: log IMG [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] epsilon (Li) = 0.48 $\pm$ 0.07, 1.62 $\pm$ 0.02, and 1.07 $\pm$ 0.02, respectively. The Li abundance of HIP 102152 is the lowest reported to date for a solar twin, and allows us to consider an emerging, tightly constrained Li-age trend for solar twin stars.},

In astronomy, over the past decade, we have also seen a steady increase in the number of papers that employ Monte Carlo\textendash{}based Bayesian analysis. New, efficient Monte Carlo\textendash{}based methods are continuously being developed and explored. In this review, we first explain the basics of Bayesian theory and discuss how to set up data analysis problems within this framework. Next, we provide an overview of various Monte Carlo\textendash{}based methods for performing Bayesian data analysis. Finally, we discuss advanced ideas that enable us to tackle complex problems and thus hold great promise for the future. We also distribute downloadable computer software (https://github.com/sanjibs/bmcmc) Python that implements some of the algorithms and examples discussed here.},

Despite the presence of strong magnetic fields, thefraction of a star or brown dwarf's energy converted intochromospheric activity weakens for ``ultracool dwarfs''with temperatures below the M6 spectral type (Giziset al. 2000; Schmidt et al. 2015). Mohanty et al. (2002)have shown this can be understood as a consequence ofthe increasingly neutral atmospheres: As the ionizationfraction drops and the resistance increases, the magneticfields become decoupled from the matter. These wereequilibrium calculations, and as Mohanty et al. (2002)noted, the existence of flares implies transient, time-dependent processes are important. A transition fromfast magnetic reconnection at high temperatures to ahigh resistivity regime where only slow magnetic recon-nection is allowed may explain the decline in chromo-spheric and coronal activity but continued radio emis-sion (Mullan 2010). This scenario sees the fast reconnec-tion events resulting in a range of energy release events,from many nanoflares that heat the chromosphere andcorona to rarer but more powerful white light flaresthat can be individually observed. Additional param-eters seem to be important in magnetic activity: Mag-netic topology may explain the difference between radio-quiet, X-ray bright dwarfs and the radio-loud, X-rayfaint dwarfs (Cook et al. 2014; Williams et al. 2014).},

The reliability of the resulting planetary candidate list relies on the ability to identify and remove false positives. Major sources of astrophysical false positives are planetary transits and stellar eclipses on background stars. We describe several new techniques for the identification of background transit sources that are separated from their target stars, indicating an astrophysical false positive. These techniques use only Kepler photometric data. We describe the concepts and construction of these techniques in detail as well as their performance and relative merits.},

        photometric and spectroscopic observations covering the
        wavelength range 1200-1800 A. A flare energy budget over the
        entire optical and ultraviolet wavelength region is constructed
        as a function of time during the flare. The continuum radiation
        is shown to be the dominant source of energy loss during both
        the initial 'impulsive' phase and the later 'gradual' phase. The
        emission lines contribute less than 10 percent of the total
        flare energy in this wavelength region but are about four times
        more important during the gradual phase than in the impulsive
        phase. The energy budget is compared with another, less
        energetic, flare on AD Leo and found to be quite similar. The
        relationships between the integrated properties of several flare
        emission features are investigated. Good correlation between
        H-gamma and Ca II K emission, and H-gamma and U filter emission
        is found. It is inferred from these correlations that the
        observed emission features are produced under similar
        atmospheric conditions regardless of the total flare energy
        emitted.}",

While spots and faculae do not seem to affect transit detections in IR, flares can and will.
Jim suggests accounting the overlaps with flares using ground based photometry in order to calibrate out the flares

~
Thoughts:

Calibration observations should be done in the optical or maybe radio to make it useful for ground based calibrations.
For the latter we would need a good understanding of flare timing in different bands. Here, least risk is expected for monitoring in the optical

It is quite interesting to see that solar flares and superflares on Sun-like stars are roughly on the same power-law line. This suggests that the mechanism of superflares is similar to that of solar flares and microflares, because white-light flare energy is roughly in proportion to EUV and X-ray flare energy.
The difference in the activity level of the Sun (or sunspot number or total magnetic flux) leads to the difference in solar flare frequency in the different phases of the solar activity cycle.
According to the measurement of the impulsive nitrate events in polar ice, the largest proton flare event during the past 450 yr is theCarrington event (Shea et al. 2006), which occurred on 1859 September 1 (Carrington 1859). The total energy released in this flare was estimated to be on the order of 10 32 erg (Tsurutani et al. 2003), which is only 1/1000 of the maximum energy of flares on the slowly rotating Sun-like stars we detected.
The rotational velocity of the Sun is $\sim$2 km s -1 (rotational period is 25 days) and the age of our Sun is 4.6 Gyr. Do superflares really occur on Sun-like stars most similar to the Sun which have a rotational period longer than 25 days? Table 7 shows 4 superflares (5.0 \texttimes{} 10 34 , 2.4 \texttimes{} 10 34 , 9.9 \texttimes{} 10 33 , and 4.4 \texttimes{} 10 34 erg) that occurred on Sun-like stars with surface temperatures of 5600 K $<$ T eff $<$ 6000 K and rotationalperiods longer than 25 days. The number of such stars is about 5000 in our sample. This implies that superflares whose total energy is of the order of 10 34 erg might occur on our Sun once in $\sim$2000 yr, although more detailed analysis is needed.
Miyake et al. (2012) reported an occurrence of an energetic cosmic-ray event in the eighth century recorded in a tree ring of Japanese cedar trees. There is a possibility that this event was produced by a superflare (with energy of $\sim$10 35 erg) on our Sun.},

     abstract = "{Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is
        precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass
        stars ({\ensuremath{\leq}}slant 1 \{M\}$_{☉ }$). Unfortunately,
        rotation period (\{P\}$_{\{\{rot}$\}\}) measurements of low-mass
        members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars
        spin down with a common age dependence (i.e.,
        \{P\}$_{\{\{rot}$\}\} \textbackslashpropto
        \textbackslashsqrt\{age\}\}): K dwarfs appear to spin down more
        slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag{\"u}eros et al. interpreted data
        for the {\ensuremath{\approx}}1.4 Gyr-old cluster NGC 752
        differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-
        rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of
        Praesepe), K dwarf \{P\}$_{\{\{rot}$\}\} stall on that sequence
        for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to
        identify likely single-star members of the
        {\ensuremath{\approx}}1 Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler
        light curves. We measure \{P\}$_{\{\{rot}$\}\} for 171 members,
        more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog
        and extending the mass limit from {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.8 to
        {\ensuremath{\approx}}0.6 \{M\}$_{☉ }$. We then apply a
        gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to
        27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise
        gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included,
        NGC 6811's color-\{P\}$_{\{\{rot}$\}\} sequence deviates away
        from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to
        \{T\}$_{\{\{eff}$\}\}{\ensuremath{\approx}} 4295 K (K5V, 0.7
        \{M\}$_{☉ }$), where it clearly overlaps with
        Praesepe{\textquoteright}s. Combining these data with
        \{P\}$_{\{\{rot}$\}\} for other clusters, we conclude that the
        assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is
        invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that
        stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency
        where \{P\}$_{\{\{rot}$\}\} stall, and that the duration of this
        epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.}",

The effect is orders of magnitude greater than conventional photon noise. It depends on the dwell time of the speckle pattern, the brightness of the star, and the fraction (1 - S) of residual light in the halo ( S being the Strehl ratio of the image). These predictions agree well with limits found using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope adaptive optics bonnette. The limiting brightness for detection is proportional to (1 - S)/S, emphasizing the need for large Strehl ratios. Strategies to reduce speckle noise are proposed; the encouraging results of a test are presented.},

refs to Dias catalog of all open clusters known at that time (\textasciitilde{}1,500) around 2002.
investigate 1876 open clusters
use three different methods to assess membership
good agreement with most earlier catalogs
80\% of all cluster have a convergent solution for all three methods (M1, M2, M3)
homogeneous sample
available online

M1 (sampedro\_stellar\_2016):

membership probs from Euclidian distance to the cluster center in N-dimensional space
reduces an N-dimensional regression to a 1D problem
iterative Wolfe estimation
applied to proper motion data

M2 (cabrera-cano\_non-parametric\_1990):

non-parametric, Bayesian
hypothesis 1: there are two population: cluster and field stars
hypothesis 2: cluster members are more densely populated than field stars
Gaussian kernel analysis with discriminant analysis
exclude stars with P$<$50\% after each iteration

M3 (cabrera-cano\_analysis\_1985):

parametric approach
uses only proper motion
fits the PDF of the whole sample by a mixture of two bivariate Gaussian distributions, one for the cluster members and other for the field stars
iterative Wolfe estimation for parameter estimation of the cluster
member if P$>$50\%

solar brightness variation is not precisely known for times before a few decades ago. How can we reconstruct the past of solar variability, especially talking about Maunder minimum and similar events.
HD173701 is almost identical to the Sun with respect to radius, mass, and age, but it has a metalicity that is twice the Sun's.
The standard deviation of the photometric variability of HD 173701 is 2.4\textendash{}4.8 times larger than the photometric variability observed in the Sun.
The rotation periods are comparable, therefore rotation cannot explain the difference in variability here. Authors suggest that metallicity could be a cause instead (caveats apply, see below)

~
Thoughts:

What about fossil field, geometry of large scale field?
Solar observations of variability expand only to the last few decades, we also do not know about the solar magnetic properties during Grand Minima, the Sun might be in a very low activity phase instead.

Finally, goals for future work at infrared wavelengths are presented in conjunction with ground and space-based observations.},

The power-law index is not correlated with rotation parameters (rotation period, projected rotational velocity, Rossby number) and only marginally with the X-ray luminosity, the flare occurrence rate is correlated with all of them.

Thought: FFD might reduce its offset with age but slope could stay the same.

Energetic flares occur more often in X-ray bright stars than in X-ray faint stars
If FFD steepen towards lower energies, they could provide enough energy to heat the corona
Trend for lower indices at later spectral types, although the significance is marginal.

Methods:

Cumulative FFDs do not account for uncertainties in the flare occurrence rates. Differential FFDs avoid this effect and include uncertainties in a natural way.

  abstract = {Temporary enhancements of the coronal emission measure in a quiet region have been shown to constitute a significant energy input. Here some relatively large events are studied for simultaneous brightenings in transition region lines and in radio emission. Associated emissions are discussed and tested for characteristics known from full-sized impulsive flares in active regions. Heating events and flares are found to have many properties in common, including (i) associated polarized radio emission, which usually precedes the emission measure peak (Neupert effect) and sometimes has a non-thermal spectrum, and (ii) associated and often preceding peaks in O\,v and He\,i emission. On the other hand, heating events also differ from impulsive flares: (i) In half of the cases, their radio emission at centimeter waves shows a spectrum consistent with thermal radiation, (ii) the ratio of the gyro-synchrotron emission to the estimated thermal soft X-ray emission is smaller than in flares, and (iii) the associated emission in the O\,v transition region line shows red shifts and blue shifts, indicating upflows in the rise phase and downflows in the decay phase, respectively. Nevertheless, the differences seem to be mainly quantitative, and the analyzed heating events with thermal energies around 1026~erg may in principle be considered as microflares or large nanoflares, thus small versions of regular flares.},

  abstract = {We present a study of white light flares from the active M5.5 dwarf Proxima Centauri using the Canadian microsatellite MOST. Using 37.6 days of monitoring data from 2014 and 2015, we have detected 66 individual flare events, the largest number of white light flares observed to date on Proxima Cen. Flare energies in our sample range from 1029-1031.5 erg. The flare rate is lower than that of other classic flare stars of similar spectral type, such as UV Ceti, which may indicate Proxima Cen had a higher flare rate in its youth. Proxima Cen does have an unusually high flare rate given its slow rotation period, however. Extending the observed power-law occurrence distribution down to 1028 erg, we show that flares with flux amplitudes of 0.5\% occur 63 times per day, while superflares with energies of 1033 erg occur \textasciitilde{}8 times per year. Small flares may therefore pose a great difficulty in searches for transits from the recently announced 1.27 M\_earth Proxima b, while frequent large flares could have significant impact on the planetary atmosphere.},

In spectroscopic flare studies, flare rates are unusual s the observation time is more limted than for photometric studies, instead one uses ``flare duty cycles'', meaning that during the entire period of observation, flares occur during a certain percentage of the time.
Flares with the same energy exhibit apparent magnitude variations that depend on the brightness of the star during quiescence (the so-called contrast effect).
flaring fraction increases from M0 to M9
M4-6 dwarfs: flares occur on stars that are preferentially closer to the Galactic plane than the inactive stars, and closer even than the active population. If we interpret this in terms of an age effect, it suggests that flare stars (which are a subset of the active population) are younger than the magnetically active stars as a whole.

Questions:

What are the effects of cosmics in spectroscopy?

We developed a separate criterion to identify pixels as CRs in the line regions, so as not to reject genuine emission: a pixel within the line region was called a CR if the difference between that pixel and the continuum level was more than 10 times the standard deviation of the other pixels in the region.

At the activity cycle minimum of eps Eri, the poloidal component makes up 74-84\% of the total large scale field
Of the latter, 50\% are dipolar, \textasciitilde{}20\% are quadrupolar and \textasciitilde{}20\% are octupolar, by which the star diverges from solar behaviour
While the Sun's quadrupolar part of the poloidal field is highest at solar max, in has a local minimum fpr Eridani in this phase
61 Cygni, however, shows a very Sun-like behaviour despite being similar to Eridani in mass.
Although sun-like stars exhibit activity cycles, their geometry varies significantly.

dwarf first discovered during a powerful $\increment$V $<$ -11 magnitude flare observed as part of the ASAS-SN
survey. Optical and infrared spectroscopy indicate a spectral type of L0 with strong H$\alpha$ emission and
a blue NIR spectral slope. Combining the photometric distance, proper motion, and radial velocity
of SDSS0533 yields three-dimensional velocities of (U, V, W ) = (14 $\pm$ 13, -35 $\pm$ 14, -94 $\pm$ 22) km s -1 ,
indicating that it is most likely part of the thick disk population and probably old. The three detections
of SDSS0533 obtained during the flare are consistent with a total V -band flare energy of at least
4.9 \texttimes{} 10 33 ergs (corresponding to a total thermal energy of at least E tot $>$ 3.7 \texttimes{} 10 34 erg), placing it
among the strongest detected M dwarf flares. The presence of this powerful flare on an old L0 dwarf
may indicate that stellar-type magnetic activity persists down to the end of the main sequence and
on older ML transition dwarfs.},

The new photometric zero points are adjusted to leave the median in the Galactic north unchanged for compatibility with previous SDSS work. We also identify transient non-photometric periods in SDSS (``contrails'') based on photometric deviations co-temporal in SDSS bands. The recalibrated stellar PSF photometry of SDSS and PS1 has an rms difference of 9, 7, 7, 8 mmag in griz , respectively, when averaged over 15  ${'}$ regions.},

  abstract = {Speckles dominate shot noise within the halo of adaptively corrected bright star images and, consequently, impose severe limits on ground-based attempts to directly detect planets around nearby stars. The effect is orders of magnitude greater than conventional photon noise. It depends on the dwell time of the speckle pattern, the brightness of the star, and the fraction (1 - S) of residual light in the halo ( S being the Strehl ratio of the image). These predictions agree well with limits found using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope adaptive optics bonnette. The limiting brightness for detection is proportional to (1 - S)/S, emphasizing the need for large Strehl ratios. Strategies to reduce speckle noise are proposed; the encouraging results of a test are presented.},

  abstract = {Solar flares are observed at all wavelengths from decameter radio waves to gamma-rays beyond 1~GeV. This review focuses on recent observations in EUV, soft and hard X-rays, white light, and radio waves. Space missions such as RHESSI, Yohkoh, TRACE, SOHO, and more recently Hinode and SDO have enlarged widely the observational base. They have revealed a number of surprises: Coronal sources appear before the hard X-ray emission in chromospheric footpoints, major flare acceleration sites appear to be independent of coronal mass ejections, electrons, and ions may be accelerated at different sites, there are at least 3 different magnetic topologies, and basic characteristics vary from small to large flares. Recent progress also includes improved insights into the flare energy partition, on the location(s) of energy release, tests of energy release scenarios and particle acceleration. The interplay of observations with theory is important to deduce the geometry and to disentangle the various processes involved. There is increasing evidence supporting magnetic reconnection as the basic cause. While this process has become generally accepted as the trigger, it is still controversial how it converts a considerable fraction of the energy into non-thermal particles. Flare-like processes may be responsible for large-scale restructuring of the magnetic field in the corona as well as for its heating. Large flares influence interplanetary space and substantially affect the Earth's ionosphere. Flare scenarios have slowly converged over the past decades, but every new observation still reveals major unexpected results, demonstrating that solar flares, after 150~years since their discovery, remain a complex problem of astrophysics including major unsolved questions.},

lowest frequency radio flares ever detected: 100-200 MHz
flares only visible in polarization, not in Stokes I
Possible sources: plasma emission or electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. ECM is more likely because it produces elliptical polarization

Radio flares on M dwarfs:

coherent emission at frequencies lower than 5GHz

Vocab:

Polarization leakage: Mechanical and electronic imperfections can result into polarization leakage

Everything refers to M dwarfs

mass-period relation: lowest-mass stars reach the fastest rotation rates and maintain rapid rotation for longer
mid M dwarfs spin down to longer periods than earlier M dwarfs
age-rotation relation is valid also if age is determined from vertical Galactic velocities
rotation seems to be independent of metallicity
fast spin-down around P=10d is observed by a gap in the distribution or rotation periods
gyrochronology could in principle be expanded beyond 5 Gyr

	Abstract = {The relationship between age, rotation, and magnetic activity can be used to roughly estimate the ages of solar-type stars. At lower stellar masses, the relationship between activity and age changes due to the less efficient angular momentum loss, and may disappear entirely for ultracool (late-M and L) dwarfs. The detection of flares (as a tracer of magnetic activity) can be combined with kinematic tracers of age to explore the relationship between age and activity for ultracool dwarfs. The final data release of Gaia will provide time-resolved photometry of Gaia targets in the G filter, but the effect of flares in the G-band is not well understood. I use a simple flare model to estimate the conversion of flare magnitudes for M3-L5 dwarfs in the Johnson V-, SDSS r-, and Kepler- bands to the Gaia G-band. By applying those conversions to previously observed flare rates, I estimate that M0-M6 dwarfs will have a flare rate in Gaia of Rf,Gaia gtrsim 8.73 × 10-4 hr-1 deg-2, corresponding to a total of gtrsim 20,000 flares in the whole survey. If ultracool dwarfs have the same flare rate, I would expect a total of gtrsim 20 flares on M7-L5 dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a 4030 deg2 near-infrared proper motion survey using multi-epoch data from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). We find 2778 proper motion candidates, 647 of which are not listed in SIMBAD. After comparison to Digitized Sky Survey images, we find that 107 of our proper motion candidates lack counterparts at B, R, and I bands and are thus 2MASS-only detections. We present results of spectroscopic follow-up of 188 targets that include the infrared-only sources along with selected optical-counterpart sources with faint reduced proper motions or interesting colors. We also establish a set of near-infrared spectroscopic standards with which to anchor near-infrared classifications for our objects. Among the discoveries are six young field brown dwarfs, five "red L" dwarfs, three L-type subdwarfs, twelve M-type subdwarfs, eight "blue L" dwarfs, and several T dwarfs. We further refine the definitions of these exotic classes to aid future identification of similar objects. We examine their kinematics and find that both the "blue L" and "red L" dwarfs appear to be drawn from a relatively old population. This survey provides a glimpse of the kinds of research that will be possible through time-domain infrared projects such as the UKIDSS Large Area Survey, various VISTA surveys, and WISE, and also through z- or y-band enabled, multi-epoch surveys such as Pan-STARRS and LSST.  Some of the spectroscopic data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. Other spectroscopic data were collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of the wide L1.5+L4.5 binary 2MASS J15200224-4422419AB, identified during spectroscopic follow-up of high proper motion sources selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. This source was independently identified by Kendall et al. in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey. Resolved JHK photometry and low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that this system is composed of two well-separated (1.174''+/-0.016'') L dwarfs. Component classifications are derived using both spectral ratios and comparison to the near-infrared spectra of previously classified field L dwarfs. Physical association for the pair is deduced from the large common proper motion of the components (mu=0.73''+/-0.03'' yr-1) and their similar spectrophotometric distances (19+/-2 pc). The projected separation of the binary, 22+/-2 AU, is consistent with maximum separation/total system-mass trends for very low mass binaries. The 2MASS J1520-4422 system exhibits both large tangential (66+/-7 km s-1) and radial velocities (-70+/-18 km s-1), and its motion in the local standard of rest suggests that it is an old member of the Galactic disk population. This system joins a growing list of well-separated (>0.5"), very low mass binaries, and is an excellent target for resolved optical spectroscopy to constrain its age, as well as trace activity/rotation trends near the hydrogen-burning limit.},

	Abstract = {Evidence is presented that 2MASS J03202839-0446358, a late-type dwarf with discrepant optical (M8:) and near-infrared (L1) spectral types, is an as-yet unresolved stellar/brown dwarf binary with late-type M dwarf and T dwarf components. This conclusion is based on low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy that reveals a subtle but distinctive absorption feature at 1.6 mu m . The feature, which is also present in the combined light spectrum of the M8.5 + T6 binary SCR 1845-6357, arises from the combination of FeH absorption from an M8.5 primary and pseudocontinuum flux from a T5 $\pm$ 1 secondary, as ascertained from binary spectral templates constructed from empirical data. The binary templates provide a far superior match to the overall near-infrared spectral energy distribution of 2MASS J0320-0446 than any single comparison spectra. Laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) imaging observations, including the first application of LGS AO aperture mask interferometry, fail to resolve a faint companion, restricting the projected separation of the system to less than 8.3 AU at the time of observation. 2MASS J0320-0446 is the second very low mass binary to be identified from unresolved, low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that complements traditional high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic methods.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

These sources were culled from a large near-infrared spectral sample of L and T dwarfs observed with the Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX spectrograph. Candidates were selected on the basis of spectral ratios which segregate known (resolved) L dwarf/T dwarf pairs from presumably single sources. Composite templates, constructed by combining 13,581 pairs of absolute flux-calibrated spectra, are shown to provide statistically superior fits to the spectra of our 17 candidates as compared to single templates. Ten of these candidates appear to have secondary components that are significantly brighter than their primaries over the 1.0-1.3 mum band, indicative of rapid condensate depletion at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition. Our results support prior indications of enhanced multiplicity amongst early-type T dwarfs; 53% $\pm$ 7% of the T0-T4 dwarfs in our spectral sample are found to be either resolved or unresolved (candidate) pairs, although this is consistent with an intrinsic (volume complete) brown dwarf binary fraction of only 15%. If verified, this sample of spectral binaries more than doubles the number of known L dwarf/T dwarf transition pairs, enabling a broader exploration of this poorly understood phase of brown dwarf atmospheric evolution.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of seven new T dwarfs identified in the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Low-resolution (R~150) 0.8-2.5 mum spectroscopy obtained with the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SpeX instrument reveals the characteristic H2O and CH4 bands in the spectra of these brown dwarfs. Comparison with spectral standards observed with the same instrument enables us to derive classifications of T3 to T7 for the objects in this sample. Moderate-resolution (R~1200) near-infrared spectroscopy for a subset of these discoveries reveal K I line strengths consistent with previously observed trends with spectral type. Follow-up imaging observations provide proper-motion measurements for these sources, ranging from less than 0.1" to 1.55" yr-1. One object, 2MASS 0034+0523, has a spectrophotometric distance placing it within 10 pc of the Sun. This source also exhibits a depressed K-band peak reminiscent of the peculiar T dwarf 2MASS 0937+2931 and may be a metal-poor or old, high-mass brown dwarf. We also present low-resolution SpeX data for a set of M- and L-type dwarf, subdwarf, and giant comparison stars used to classify 59 additional candidates identified as background stars. These are primarily M5-M8.5 dwarfs, many exhibiting H I Pagamma, but include three candidate ultracool M subdwarfs and one possible early-type L subdwarf.},

Features characteristic of both L and T dwarfs are present, namely, strong carbon monoxide absorption in the K band, strong methane absorption in the J and H bands, and red near-infrared colors. We consider several scenarios that could produce these features and conclude that the object is most likely to be an unresolved L/T binary system. We discuss how the estimated photometric properties of this object are consistent with the observed J-band brightening of brown dwarfs between late-L and early-T dwarfs, making detailed study of this system an important probe of the L/T transition.},

Spectral types are derived from resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of the well-separated (1.09"+/-0.06") components and comparison to equivalent data for M and L dwarf spectral standards. Physical association is deduced from the angular proximity of the sources, their common proper motion, and their similar spectrophotometric distances (35+/-2 pc). The estimated distance of this pair implies a projected separation of 38+/-3 AU, wider than typical separations for other M dwarf/L dwarf binaries but consistent with the maximum separation/total system mass trend previously identified by Burgasser et al. We discuss the DENIS 2200-3038AB system in context with other low-mass binaries and its role in the study of dust formation processes and activity trends across the transition between the M and L dwarf spectral classes.},

The stars have well-established MK spectral classifications and are mostly restricted to near-solar metallicities. The sample not only contains the F, G, K, and M spectral types with luminosity classes between I and V, but also includes some AGB, carbon, and S stars. In contrast to some other spectral libraries, the continuum shape of the spectra is measured and preserved in the data reduction process. The spectra are absolutely flux calibrated using the Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry. Potential uses of the library include studying the physics of cool stars, classifying and studying embedded young clusters and optically obscured regions of the Galaxy, evolutionary population synthesis to study unresolved stellar populations in optically obscured regions of galaxies and synthetic photometry. The library is available in digital form from the IRTF Web site.},

	Abstract = {The monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situ measurements of the response function of the mosaicked CCD imager used in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The system is outlined and the results of the measurements, mostly during the first six years of the SDSS, are described. We present the reference response functions for the five color passbands derived from these measurements, and discuss column-to-column variations and variations in time, and also their effects on photometry. We also discuss the effect arising from various, slightly different response functions of the associated detector systems that were used to give SDSS photometry. We show that the calibration procedures of SDSS remove these variations reasonably well with the resulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to be larger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of the survey. The considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the response function showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental sensitivity in the u band, which is calibrated out. The expected color variation is consistent with measured color variation in the catalog of repeated photometry. The color variation is Delta(u - g) ~ 0.01 for most stars, and at most Delta(u - g) ~ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colors. We verified in the final catalog that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag are detected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonal effects except for the secular u - g color variation for stars with extreme colors.},

	Abstract = {We combine optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectra and photometry to construct expanded spectral energy distributions for 145 field age (>500 Myr) and 53 young (lower age estimate <500 Myr) ultracool dwarfs (M6-T9). This range of spectral types includes very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary mass objects, providing fundamental parameters across both the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses for the largest sample assembled to date. A subsample of 29 objects have well constrained ages as probable members of a nearby young moving group. We use 182 parallaxes and 16 kinematic distances to determine precise bolometric luminosities (Lbol) and radius estimates from evolutionary models give semi-empirical effective temperatures (Teff) for the full range of young and field age late-M, L, and T dwarfs. We construct age-sensitive relationships of luminosity, temperature, and absolute magnitude as functions of spectral type and absolute magnitude to disentangle the effects of degenerate physical parameters such as Teff, surface gravity, and clouds on spectral morphology. We report bolometric corrections in J for both field age and young objects and find differences of up to a magnitude for late-L dwarfs. Our correction in Ks shows a larger dispersion but not necessarily a different relationship for young and field age sequences.

	Abstract = {We present the initial results of our effort to create a statistically robust, volume-limited sample of ultracool dwarfs from the Two Micron All Sky Survey Second Incremental Data Release. We are engaged in a multifaceted search for nearby late-type objects, and this is the first installment of our search using purely photometric selection. The goal of this work is a determination of the low-mass star and brown dwarf luminosity function in the infrared. Here we outline the construction of the sample, dubbed 2MU2, and present our first results, including the discovery of 186 M7-L6 dwarfs-47 of which are likely to be within 20 pc of the Sun. These results represent 66% of the ultracool candidates in our sample yet constitute a 127% increase in the number of ultracool dwarfs known within the volume searched (covering 40% of the sky out to 20 pc). In addition, we have identified 10 M4-M6.5 objects that are likely to be within 20 pc (or within 1 sigma). Finally, based on these initial data, we present a preliminary luminosity function and discuss several interesting features of the partial sample presented here. Once our sample is complete, we will use our measured luminosity function to constrain the mass function of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic catalog of 70,841 visually inspected M dwarfs from the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each spectrum, we provide measurements of the spectral type, a number of molecular band heads, and the Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta, and Ca II K emission lines. In addition, we calculate the metallicity-sensitive parameter zeta and identify a relationship between zeta and the g - r and r - z colors of M dwarfs. We assess the precision of our spectral types (which were assigned by individual examination), review the bulk attributes of the sample, and examine the magnetic activity properties of M dwarfs, in particular those traced by the higher order Balmer transitions. Our catalog is cross-matched to Two Micron All Sky Survey infrared data, and contains photometric distances for each star. Finally, we identify eight new late-type M dwarfs that are possibly within 25 pc of the Sun. Future studies will use these data to thoroughly examine magnetic activity and kinematics in late-type M dwarfs and examine the chemical and dynamical history of the local Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We report on new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) and mass function (MF) of field low-mass dwarfs derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 photometry. The analysis incorporates ~15 million low-mass stars (0.1 M_o M < 0.8 M_o), spread over 8400 deg2. Stellar distances are estimated using new photometric parallax relations, constructed from ugriz photometry of nearby low-mass stars with trigonometric parallaxes. We use a technique that simultaneously measures Galactic structure and the stellar LF from 7 < Mr < 16. We compare the LF to previous studies and convert to an MF using the mass-luminosity relations of Delfosse et al. The system MF, measured over -1.0< log M / M_o <-0.1, is well described by a lognormal distribution with M_{\circ } = 0.25 M_o. We stress that our results should not be extrapolated to other mass regimes. Our work generally agrees with prior low-mass stellar MFs and places strong constraints on future theoretical star formation studies.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of 484 L dwarfs, 210 of which are newly discovered from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 spectroscopic database. We combine this sample with known L dwarfs to investigate their izJHKS colors. Our spectroscopically selected sample has ~0.1 mag bluer median J - KS color at a given spectral type (for L0-L4) than previously known L dwarfs, which reflects a bias toward redder L dwarfs in past selection criteria. We present photometric distance relations based on i - z and i - J colors and derive distances to our L dwarf sample. We combine the distances with SDSS/2MASS proper motions in order to examine the tangential velocities. For the majority of our spectroscopic sample, we measured radial velocities and present three-dimensional kinematics. We also provide Halpha detections for the fraction of our sample with sufficient quality spectra. Comparison of the velocities of our L dwarf sample to a kinematic model shows evidence for both cold and hot dynamical populations, consistent with young and old disk components. The dispersions of these components are similar to those found for M dwarfs. We also show that J - KS color is correlated with velocity dispersion, confirming a relationship between J - KS color and age.},

	Abstract = {We present the colors and activity of ultracool (M7--L8) dwarfs from the Tenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We combine previous samples of SDSS M and L dwarfs with new data obtained from the Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (BOSS) to produce the BOSS Ultracool Dwarf (BUD) sample of 11820 M7--L8 dwarfs. By combining SDSS data with photometry from 2MASS and the Wide-field Infrared Sky Explorer (WISE) mission, we present ultracool dwarf colors from i-z to W2-W3 as a function of spectral type, and extend the SDSS--2MASS--WISE color locus to include ultracool dwarfs. The i-z, i-J, and z-J colors provide the best indication of spectral type for M7--L3 dwarfs. We also examine ultracool dwarf chromospheric activity through the presence and strength of Hα emission. The fraction of active dwarfs rises through the M spectral sequence until it reaches ∼90% at spectral type L0. The fraction of active dwarfs then declines to 50% at spectral type L5; no Hα emission is observed in the late-L dwarfs in the BUD sample. The fraction of active L0--L5 dwarfs is much higher than previously observed. The strength of activity declines with spectral type from M7 through L3, after which the data do not show a clear trend. Using one-dimensional chromosphere models, we explore the range of filling factors and chromospheric temperature structures that are consistent with Hα observations of M0--L7 dwarfs. M dwarf chromospheres have a similar, smoothly varying range of temperature and surface coverage, while L dwarf chromospheres are cooler and have smaller filling factors.},

	Abstract = {We present optical template spectra, bolometric corrections, and χ values for ultracool dwarfs. The templates are based on spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope. The spectral features and overall shape of the L dwarf templates are consistent with previous spectroscopic standards and the templates have a radial velocity precision of ˜10-20 km s-1. We calculate bolometric fluxes (accurate to 10-20%) for 101 late-M and L dwarfs from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, SDSS spectra, and BT-Settl model spectra. We find that the z-band and J-band bolometric corrections for late-M and L dwarfs have a strong correlation with z-J and J-KScolors, respectively. The new χ values, which can be used to convert Hα equivalent widths to activity strength, are based on spectrophotometrically calibrated SDSS spectra and the new bolometric fluxes. While the measured χ values have typical uncertainties of ˜20%, ultracool dwarf models show the continuum surrounding Hα can vary by up to an order of magnitude with changing surface gravity. Our semiempirical χ values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous χ values for mid-to-late L dwarfs, indicating that the upper limits for Hα activity strength on the coolest L dwarfs have been underestimated.},
