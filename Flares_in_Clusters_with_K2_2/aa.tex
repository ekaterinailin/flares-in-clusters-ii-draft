\section{Introduction}
%The impressive morphology of flares has incited our curiosity for decades. Yet the underlying physical processes are still not fully understood on the Sun, and even less so on other stars.
Flares are explosions on stellar surfaces with a complex spatio-temporal and energetic phenomenology. We know that flares are magnetic re-connection events that lead to a change in field line topology and subsequent energy release~\citep{priest_magnetic_2002}. We can observe flares in nearly all electromagnetic bands, from radio %Vilhu et al. 1993, Gudel et al. 1995b,1998, Berger 2002
to X-ray, and on all stars that possess a convection zone, from late F type stars to ultracool dwarfs~\citep{gizis2013}. 
%But even with continuous monitoring at high temporal resolution, the random occurrence of solar flares makes them costly observing targets, especially in coordinated multi-band observations. In integrated light, most solar flares have a far too low contrast and intensity to be observable. 
Stellar flares on cool stars can enhance the optical flux by up to several orders of magnitude within minutes or seconds. They typically exhibit blackbody emission at temperatures significantly higher than these stars' photospheres. The high intensity and contrast allow us to measure magnetic activity as traced by flares for a broader range of stars than is available to other methods.
\\
%With the evidence that the physical processes that cause flares on the Sun and other stars are the same~\citep{karoff_observational_2016}, solar and stellar flares can inform each other~\citep{shibayama_2013}. Inconsistencies in extrapolations from solar to stellar conditions~\citep{Aarnio2011, aarnio_masslosscme_2012, drake_cmemassloss_2013} provide valuable clues to the differences in magnetic properties between Sun and M dwarfs, too~\citep{alvaradogomez_cme_2018}. 
Statistical flare studies have been pioneered from the ground~\citep{lacy_uv_1976}. But it was not until space missions like Kepler and TESS enabled the investigation of stellar ensembles that were not pre-selected for their activity~\citep{walkowicz2011}. Statistical studies of stellar flaring activity can help us understand the underlying physical processes of flares~CITE, the nature of stellar surface magnetic fields, starspots~\citep{davenport_flaresandspots_2015, howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}, how flares relate to stellar angular momentum evolution~\citep{mondrik2019, howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}, and how they affect the atmospheres of exoplanets~\citep{lecavelier_flareescape_2012, loyd_mflaresplanetsfuv_2018, tilley_repeated_flare_2019, howard2019}.%, and inform galactic archaeology~\citep{hilton2010,howard2019}. %But we also must scrutinize the assumption, and clarify the circumstances under which solar and stellar flares can be related. From G to L
\\
The present study has a focus on the relation between flares and stellar evolution of low-mass stars on the main sequence. To this end, we set out to quatify how flaring activity changes as a function stellar mass and age. 

In main sequence stars, flaring activity is known to peak in intensity around spectral type M5. In fact, the prototype flare star, UV Ceti, is an M6 dwarf~\citep{kirkpatrick1991}.

We learned that flaring activity decayed with age as we observed its decline with galactic latitude for M dwarfs~\citep{hilton2010, walkowicz2011, howard2019}. According to gyrochronology, fast rotation indicates young age~\citep{barnes_rotational_2003}, and slows down as the star ages. Short rotation periods and high magnetic activity measured in H$\alpha$ are strongly correlated~\citep{west_magneticrotationage_2015}. 


Ages can be controlled for in coeval groups of stars. Flaring-age studies in binaries showed consistency in activity for both components in the majority of targets~\citep{lurie2015, clarke_flare_2018}. Open clusters are also coeval groups of stars with well-determined ages that have been used as a laboratory for flares studies on stars with a fixed age~\citep{chang2015}. \citet{ilin_flares_2019}~(hereafter \citetalias{ilin_flares_2019}) investigated the flaring activity of late-K to mid-M dwarfs in three open clusters (OCs), the Pleiades, Praesepe, and M67, using K2 time domain photometry. They analyzed flare frequency distributions (FFDs) broken down by the stars' effective temperatures and ages. They found that flaring activity declined both with increasing mass and age, and that the trend was more pronounced for higher mass stars. 
\\
This study aimed to extend the results in \citetalias{ilin_flares_2019} to the age of Ruprecht 147 (2.5 Gyr) and M67 (3.6 Gyr), and both higher and lower masses than in the previous study. We used the now complete K2 data set, and supplemented all three OCs in~\citetalias{ilin_flares_2019} with improved versions of already treated light curves in Campaigns 4 and 5, and with additional light curves from later Campaigns. The light curve catalog, and the determination of cluster membership and effective temperature for the investigated stars are detailed in Section \ref{sec:data}. We used a semi automated flare finding procedure, and described how we estimated flare energies and how we parametrized the statistical properties of flares in Section \ref{sec:methods}. We present our findings in Section \ref{sec:results}. We placed our results in the context of recent flare studies, and reflected on the power law nature of FFDs in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. Recently, \citet{davenport2019} proposed an empirical parametrization of the flaring-mass-age relation based on FFDs of stars with gyrochronologically determined ages, which we also put to test in the discussion. The summary and conclusions can be found in Section \ref{sec:summary}.
\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
This work is based on K2 30-minute cadence light curves that were provided by the Kepler archives hosted at MAST. To assign $T_\mathrm{eff}$ to the stars for which these observation had been obtained we used multiband photometry from several all-sky surveys. To assign ages to the targeted stars, OC membership information was compiled from the literature. An overview over the cluster sample is presented in Table \ref{tab:data_clusters} and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:OCs}.

\subsection{K2 light curves}
The Kepler~\citep{koch_kepler_2010} spacecraft finished its follow-up mission K2~\citep{howell_k2_2014} in September 2018, after having completed nearly 20 80-day observing campaigns. Although Kepler and K2 data were already used in more than 2\,400 publications in 2018, the public archive was still considered understudied~\citep{barentsen_retirement_opportunities_2018}. In this spirit we took up the analysis of a total of \input{values/total_number_of_lcs.txt}light curves where each light curve contained up to $80$ uninterrupted days of $30$ min cadence observations in white light~($4,200-9,000\,\mathring{A}$).
\\
As K2 was conducted on the two-wheeled Kepler satellite, it was subjected to substantial drift motion (spacecraft roll,~\citealt{van_cleve_thats_2016}) and had an overall reduced pointing accuracy. To mitigate these effects, various solutions were developed~\citep{vanderburg_k2sff_2014, aigrain_k2sc_2016, luger_everest_2016, luger_everst_2018}. We used a minimally modified version of the K2 Systematics Correction pipeline~\citep{aigrain_k2sc_2016}, and used it to de-trend the 36th data release of the K2 data products. It was considered the final data release, and included a uniform, global reprocessing of most K2 campaigns using an improved data reduction pipeline\footnote{\url{https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html}}.
\subsection{Open clusters}
We obtained membership information from multiple catalogs for each cluster. We cross-matched these catalogs on RA and declination within 3 arcsec. The resulting target lists were used to search the K2 archive. One part of the membership catalogs provided membership probabilities~\citep{douglas_praesepe_hyades_2014, cantat_gaudin_2018, olivares_pleiades_2018, reino_hyades_2018, gao_m67mem_2018, olivares_ngc6774_2019}. For the other part no probability was quoted~\citep{rebull_rotation_2016, douglas_poking_2017, gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}, or qualitative classifiers were given~\citep{curtis_ruprecht_2013, gonzalez_m67mem_2016,rebull_praesepe_2017}. In the latter cases we assigned approximate probabilities anchored to the set threshold for inclusion into our final sample. Absence in a catalog did not decrease the likelihood of membership, as each catalog shows different selection biases which we did not address in this study. We set the threshold mean membership probability $p$ for a target in our sample to 0.8.
\\
% For the more distant clusters, Ruprecht 147 and M35, we use the mean cluster distance. For the nearby Pleiades, Praesepe, and most importantly the Hyades, we match our targets with Gaia DR2~\citep{gaia_dr2_release_2018} distances, or use mean distances as fallback option. Ages and metallicities are taken from literature, adopting median values when multiple studies were considered, and excluding studies that appear outdated.
We studied flaring activity in the low mass stars in five open clusters spanning from ZAMS to solar age. Table \ref{tab:data_clusters} provides an overview over the final sample. The literature overview of age, distance, and metallicity determinations is given in Table \ref{tab:app:oc_parameters} in the Appendix. Membership probability histograms of the final sample are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:app:membership}.

\subsubsection{Pleiades}
%age distance citation?
The Pleiades, a nearby ZAMS cluster, were observed in Campaign 4, and were treated in \citetalias{ilin_flares_2019}. We include the cluster in this work for completeness and to include improvements to~\citepalias{ilin_flares_2019}. We revisited the memberships from~\citet{rebull_rotation_2016}, which were your in the previous work, and merged them with lists of members determined by~\citet{olivares_pleiades_2018, gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}; and~\citet{cantat_gaudin_2018}.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsubsection{M35}
%age distance citation?
%M35 is a ZAMS cluster 900 pc away, observed during Campaign 0 in K2. We merged membership lists from \citet{cantat_gaudin_2018, gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}; and ~\citet{bouy_messier_2015}. There are only five K2 light curves, but we identified multiple additional members with publicly available\footnote{\url{https://k2.hatsurveys.org/archive/}} light curves obtained from \citet{soares_furtado_m35_2017}. They used an image subtraction technique in the campaign's super stamps, a self flat-fielding de-trending inspired by K2SFF~\citep{vanderburg_k2sff_2014}, and a trend-filtering algorithm developed by \citet{kovacs_tfa_algorithm_2005}. We preferred PSF photometry in cases where both aperture K2 and PSF LCs were available. We took the raw extracted PSF light curves and de-trended them using \texttt{K2SC}.
%AMC extracted 1-4 pixel aperture light curves from superstamps in the M35 field, too. We compared the noise levels between the LCs derived from the few-pixel apertures to the PSF case using the median value of a rolling band standard deviation as an estimate.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Hyades}
%age distance citation?
The Hyades are a 0.6 Gyr old OC that were observed during Campaigns 4 and 13 with K2. It is about as old as Praesepe. We merged membership tables obtained from \citet{douglas_praesepe_hyades_2014, reino_hyades_2018}; and \citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Praesepe}
%age distance citation?
Praesepe appeared in Campaign 5, and was also treated in~\citetalias{ilin_flares_2019}. It was then observed again during Campaigns 16, and 18. We revisited the memberships obtained by \citet{douglas_praesepe_hyades_2014}, and matched them to the members identified in \citet{douglas_poking_2017, rebull_praesepe_2017,cantat_gaudin_2018}; and ~\citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Ruprecht 147}
%age distance citation?
Ruprecht 147 is a 2.5 Gyr old OC observed during Campaign 7 with K2. We used the mean membership probabilities obtained from a number of studies~\citep{curtis_ruprecht_2013, cantat_gaudin_2018, olivares_ngc6774_2019} combined with the members found by~\citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd} to identify the most likely members.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{M67}
%age distance citation?
M67 is a solar-age, solar metallicity OC about 900 pc away. Multiple members were observed during Campaign 5, and revisited in Campaigns 16 and 18. We did not find any flares in M67 in Campaign 5~\citepalias{ilin_flares_2019} light curves of members identified by \citet{gonzalez_m67mem_2016}. Campaigns 16 and 18 delivered both additional observations, and new targets to the sample. We merged the members from \citet{gonzalez_m67mem_2016} with a recent study based of Gaia DR2 data~\citep{gao_m67mem_2018}.

%\subsubsection{Photometry and extinction correction}
We determined effective temperatures $T_\mathrm{eff}$ using broadband photometry the Two Micron All Sky Survey~(2MASS; \citealt{skrutskie_two_2006}), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System \mbox{(Pan-STARRS)} Data Release 1~(PanSTARRS DR1; \citealt{2016arXiv161205560C}), and Gaia Data Release 2~(Gaia DR2; \citealt{gaia_dr2_release_2018}). We applied quality cuts to 2MASS, Pan-STARRS DR1, and Gaia DR2 data, as described in Appendix \ref{sec:app:photometry}, and removed foreground stars using Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We corrected the 2MASS and PanSTARRS photometry in M67 and Ruprecht 147 for extinction using the most recent version~\citep{green_bayestar_2019} of the \texttt{dustmaps} package that provides 3D dust maps derived from 2MASS and PanSTARRS photometry together with Gaia distances~\citep{green_dustmaps_2018}. If there was no Gaia parallax available we used the cluster median distance instead. If an extinction value was not available for a given star we used the average extinction value of the respective cluster. We accounted for extinction in Gaia BP and RP using the reddening $E(B_P-R_P)$ derived from Gaia photometry and parallax from Gaia DR2~\citep{andrae_gaiaapsis_2018}. We dropped targets that were too bright and would saturate the detector (Kepler magnitude $K_\mathrm{p} \leq 9$).
%The latter were obtained using TOPCAT~\citep{Taylor_TOPCAT_2005}\footnote{\url{http://www.star.bristol.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/}}.
\\
\subsubsection{Effective temperatures}
We applied several methods and color-temperature relations (CTRs) to determine robust $T_\mathrm{eff}$. We used CTRs from \citet{boyajian_stellar_2013} and \citet{mann_erratum_2016} (erratum to \citealt{mann_how_2015}), $T_\mathrm{eff}$ derived from Gaia DR2 using the StarHorse algorithm~\citep{queiroz_starhorse_2018}, and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ inferred from Gaia DR2 using the Apsis pipeline~\citep{bailerjones_apsis_2013, andrae_gaiaapsis_2018}.
\\
\citet{boyajian_stellar_2013} determined CTRs from a range of interferometrically characterized stars using $g-z$, $g-i$, $g-r$, $g-J$, $g-H$, and $g-K$ colors from SDSS and Johnson magnitudes for A to K stars. Their sample was centered on solar metallicity, so we constained the use of these CTRs to stars with $-0.25<$\,[Fe/H]$\,<0.25$. Following \citet{boyajian_stellar_2013}, we transformed 2MASS $JHK$ to $J-H$, $H-K$, and $J-K$ in the Johnson system from 2MASS to the Bessell-Brett sytem~\citep{carpenter_color_2001}, and from Bessell-Brett to Johnson using the relations in~\citet{bessell_brett_1988}. 
\\
\citet{mann_how_2015} derived CTRs from absolutely calibrated spectra to which they fitted atmospheric models to obtain $T_\mathrm{eff}$. Alternatively, they determined $T_\mathrm{eff}$ from long-baseline optical interferometry measurements using the bolometric flux. They noted transformations for SDSS/2MASS $r-z$ and $r-J$, or Gaia $BP-RP$ where extra information could be added from metallicity or 2MASS $J-H$. The relations in \citet{mann_how_2015} were only valid if metallicity is sufficiently close to solar, which was satisfied for the OCs in this paper~(see Table \ref{tab:data_clusters}). 
\\
We supplemented our estimates with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ estimates from \citet{anders_starhorse_2019} who used the StarHorse pipeline~\citep{queiroz_starhorse_2018} on Gaia DR2.
\\
Gaia DR2 published $T_\mathrm{eff}$ for over 160 million sources~\citep{gaia_dr2_release_2018}. The typical uncertainty was quoted at 324 K, but it is lower for stars above $\sim$4100 K and below $\sim$6700K, so that we adopt 175 K which is above the quoted root-median-squared error in this $T_\mathrm{eff}$ range~\citep{andrae_gaiaapsis_2018}, and use provided values only in this range.
\\
Empirical CTRs suffer from systematic errors that stem both from the different methods applied, and from sample selection biases. We therefore used several empirical relations in their appropriate ranges to obtain $T_\mathrm{eff}$ from each, and draw a more reliable median value~(Figs. \ref{fig:teff_pleiades_hyades_praesepe} and \ref{fig:teff_ngc6774_ngc2682}). Targets that were lacking sufficient photometric data to derive $T_\mathrm{eff}$, or were too hot to be expected to have a convective envelope ($T_\mathrm{eff} \geq 7000$;K), were removed from the sample. We dropped all targets where the uncertainty on the weighted mean $T_\mathrm{eff}$ was greater than $10\,$\%. Only targets that were assigned a $T_\mathrm{eff}$ were searched for flares. 
%what are the distributions of uncertainties on Teff
\subsubsection{Stellar radii}
We used a catalog of empirically characterized stars~\citep{yee_specmatch_2017} and empirical $T_\mathrm{eff}-R_*$ relations derived by~\citet{mann_how_2015,mann_erratum_2016} to obtain $R_*$ from the $T_\mathrm{eff}$ for the stars in our sample (Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_radius}). \citet{yee_specmatch_2017} compiled 404 stars with high-resolution spectra from the literature, and performed their own observations of mid to late K-dwarfs, spanning low mass stars from 7000\;K down to 3000\;K. For these stars, the resulting catalog was accurate to 100\;K in
$T_\mathrm{eff}$, 15\;\% in $R_*$, and 0.09\;dex in [Fe/H]. We interpolated between stars from the catalog to our derived $T_\mathrm{eff}$,  and propagated the resulting scatter to the uncertainty in $R_*$ if $T_\mathrm{eff}>3500$ K. For stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}< 3500$ K we used $T_\mathrm{eff}-R_*$ relations derived by~\citet{mann_how_2015,mann_erratum_2016}. 
\subsubsection{Stellar spectra and luminosities}
\label{sec:lum}
We assigned spectra to our targets from the SpecMatchEmp~\citep{yee_specmatch_2017} and the FlareSpecPhot libraries~\citep{Schmidt2014b, Kirkpatrick2010, Burgasser2007, Burgasser2008, Burgasser2010, Burgasser2004, Cruz2004, Burgasser2006, Rayner2009, Doi2010, Filippazzo2015, Cruz2003, West2011, Bochanski2010,  Bochanski2007, Schmidt2010, Schmidt2015, Schmidt2014a, mann_how_2015}. When a specturm was available for the derived spectral type in FlareSpecPhot, we preferred it over SpecMatchEmp, which was the case for all stars cooler than M0, where we mapped spectral type to effective temperature as appears in~\citet{pecaut_intrinsic_2013}. We then combined stellar radii $R_*$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and spectra to projected bolometric luminosities $L_{\mathrm{bol,*}}$, and projected luminosities in the Kepler band $L_{\mathrm{Kp,*}}$~\citep{shibayama2013,ilin_flares_2019}. Uncertainties on $L_{\mathrm{Kp,*}}$ ranged from 9\;\% to 52\;\% with a median value of 17\;\%.
%uncertainties on derived luminosities
%\citet{rabus_discontinuity_2019} found a discontinuity in the Teff-R relation to occur around 0.23 $M_{\odot}$, and a corresponding bimodal distribution of stellar radii from $T_\mathrm{eff}$ between 3200 and 3340 K. Estimates of bolometric luminosity based on $R$ derived from $T_\mathrm{eff}$, even using empirical relations, can then be off by factors of 2 to 6. While estimates of $M_*$ can help lift this degeneracy they are not provided independently in our sample. We would then have to acknowledge the increased uncertainty in the luminosities for the stars that fall in this regime. However, the observed transition is consistent with very low mass stellar models, where it is not a break but a smooth transition in the Teff-R relation caused by the non-linear increase in the core electron degeneracy parameters with decreasing stellar mass~\citep{cassisi_nodiscontinuity_2019}. %can we account for it

We detected flare candidates automatically with the \texttt{AltaiPony} software, and validated them by eye.  %We performed injection recovery on a handful of example light curves to see that de-trending and intrinsic light curve properties smear out the $ED$ recovery with varying distributions that add an uncertainty of about 30\%. 
The frequency distributions of the energies these flares release are believed to follow a power law that spans multiple orders of magnitude. We adopted this model, and fitted the function parameters simultaneously using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to sample from the posterior distribution. 
%We tested the best fit parameters with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and probed possible truncation of the power law relation with an exceedance test.
%We attempted to assign recovery probabilities and corrected for sampling effects using injection/recovery tests but the procedure was not scalable due to computational costs.
\subsection{Flare finding}
We used the open source software \texttt{AltaiPony}\footnote{\url{altaipony.readthedocs.io}} to automatically detect and characterize flares in our sample. The code base relied on \texttt{K2SC}\footnote{\url{github.com/OxES/k2sc}}~\citep{aigrain_k2sc_2016} to remove instrumental and astrophysical variablity from K2 light curves. We did not use the de-trended light curves available on MAST\footnote{\url{archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sc/}}, but used \texttt{K2SC} to de-trend light curves from the re-processed final data release. We clipped outliers at $3\sigma$ iteratively, as compared to the original work, where outliers were clipped at $5\sigma$~\citep{aigrain_k2sc_2016}.
\\
After de-trending, the flare finder algorithm searched for continuous observing periods, defined as being longer than 10 data points at a minimum cadence of 2\;h. All further routines were run on these observing periods. The finder iteratively clipped excursions from the median value at $3\sigma$ rolling window noise above median plus uncertainty given from \texttt{K2SC} de-trending. After each iteration, outliers were cut down to the current median value. Either after convergence, or 50 iterations, the resulting median value was adopted. With this median as quiescent flux, flare candidates were identified with the same procedure as during the median value calculation, but we additionally required at least three consecutive data points to fullfil the $3\sigma$-criterion. Flare candidates were merged into single candidate events if they were less than four data points apart. For each of these candidates flaring time, amplitude and equivalent duration ($ED$) were returned.
\\
$ED$ is the area between the LC and the quiescent flux, that is, the integrated flare flux divided by the median quiescent flux $F_0$ of the star, integrated over the flare duration~\citep{gershberg1972}:
\begin{equation}
\label{05_ED}
ED=\displaystyle \int \mathrm dt\, \frac{F_{flare}(t)}{F_0}.
\end{equation}
$ED$ is a quantity independent of calibration and distance that is suited to compare flaring activity on stars where these properties are uncertain. $ED$ describes the time during which a star releases as much energy as the flare itself. This time can be shorter or longer than the actual flare duration. 
\\
The uncertainty in $ED$ depended on the light curve noise properties, time sampling, and other intrinsic characteristics. Moreover, K2SC de-trending and the flare finding procedure introduce additional uncertainty that dominates the photometric noise. Computationally, it was too costly to perform the injection and recovery of synthetic flare events to take into account the effects of GP regression that underlies K2SC. Instead we estimated the scatter in the residual flux using the iterative procedure that~(Schmidt et al. (2020) in prep.) applied to TESS light curves.
\\
The Kepler flare sample has shown to be difficult to treat in a fully automated way. Without manual vetting, the event samples remain significantly contaminated~\citep{yang_keplerflares_2019}. As K2 was subject to severe technical difficulties, the expected contamination rate was expected to be even higher. Some light curves could not be de-trended using K2SC alone. Light curves with extreme astrophysical signals like deep transits, rotational modulation on time scales of a few hours or passages of bright solar system objects (SSOs) had to be masked accordingly or fitted with an additional sinusoidal component to the K2SC-treated time series. A number of light curves were excluded from the flare search because they saturated the detector, or because the target aperture overlapped with broken pixels. Some very faint targets and extreme variables could not be searched because the de-trending did not terminate successfully. The online version of Table \ref{tab:flares} includes an additional flag and contains explanatory notes on the excluded targets. \textbf{Here is some room for SkyBot notes.}
%\subsection{Recovery probability and $ED$ correction}
%\label{recprob_edcor}
%To further validate the flare events, every candidates was re-injected to its light curve of origin several times with varying amplitude and duration using a classical flare template~\citep{davenport_kepler_2014}. This returned a recovery probability of similar flare morphologies on a given light curve. We accepted a candidate if the recovery probability was above 80\;\%. From the difference between injected and recovered values we calculated individual correction factors for all candidates that typically increased the $ED$ because the 30\;min time sampling systematically underestimates the $ED$~\citep{yang_flaresampling_2018} as compared to short cadence observations. Corrected flare $ED$s from injection-recovery validated candidates were then converted to $E_\mathrm{Kp, flare}$ and passed on to further analysis.
%\\
%How is recovery affected by GP Regression? \\
%Can we isolate sampling effects?\\
%Can we do a simpler correction by showing that most of the ED under-estimate comes from the under-sampling at 30 min cadence?
%\subsection{Complex Flares}
%Complex flares are flaring events that do not follow the classical time evolution~\citep{davenport_kepler_2014}. In many cases, observed flares can be described by superimposing multiple single events. We call these flares complex. Some flares cannot be described in this way. We call these flares atypical.
%\citet{davenport_kepler_2014} found $60-80\,\%$ of flares with duration of more 50 min to have multiple peaks, and successfully fitted them a superposition of multiple classical events to them on active M dwarf GJ 1243. However, $1.3\,\%$ of all flare detections were atypical. In the long cadence data present here, flare durations were at least 1.5\,h, and thus likely most of our candidates have a complex morphology. The time resolution, however, bars us from reconstructing the individual morphologies directly, and the flare finding algorithm is ignorant about the decay phase light curve shape.
\subsection{Kepler flare energies}
Multiband time resolved observations of active M dwarfs have shown that continuum flux accounts for the majority  of the energy radiated by flares~\citep{kowalski_time-resolved_2013}. %also Halwey+2003,  Osten/Wolk2015 (see Loyd+2018, 4.1)
The effective temperature of this blackbody, however, varies by a great degree, with, to date, no robust predictor of that temperature:
While solar flares are relatively cool, with \mbox{$T_\mathrm{eff}\approx5\,000-7\,000 $\;K}~\citep{kleint_solarstellarwlf_2016, kerr_solarstellarwlf_2014, watanabe_solarstellarwlf_2013, namekata_solarstellarwlf_2017}, SEDs of stellar flares tend to be blue~\citep{davenport_multi-wavelength_2012}. At least one M dwarf flare reached $40\,000$\;K as seen in FUV spectra~\citep{froning_40000_2019}, and most events exhibit temperatures of about $9\,000-10\,000$\;K~\citep{1992ApJS...78..565H, kretzschmar_sun_2011, shibayama2013}. 
%What will be the effect of Tflare on the Kepler band? (calculated in Cluster Analysis notebook 21)
A dependence of flare temperature on stellar age, or mass, or both, will enter our analysis if we quantify bolometric flare energy. At about $6\,200$\;K, the Kepler pass band captures the largest flux fraction, at $10\,000$\;K $72\,\%$, at $40\,000$\,K only $4\%$ of this value is transmitted. A further effect is that flares of equal flare energy but hotter SED would not be seen in the Kepler band at all. Given the uncertainties on stellar luminosity in the Kepler band (see Sec. \ref{sec:lum}) and on $ED$, the resulting flare energies~(\citetalias{ilin_flares_2019})
\begin{equation}
E_\mathrm{Kp} = L_\mathrm{Kp} \cdot ED
\end{equation}  
will substantially deviate from the true released energy. If these uncertainties did not affect all flares in a similar fashion, the present analysis will have suffered from non-uniform biases that affected the flare frequency distributions on stars of different ages and temperatures, and skewed the flare distributions within each subsample. However, the comparison to other studies (see Sec. \ref{sec:consistency_other_work}) suggested that our results were in fact dominated by the astrophysical effects of stellar parameters like mass and age on flare energies and their occurrence rates.  
%\\
%We propagated the uncertainties $\sigma_{ED}$ and $\sigma_L$ (on $L_{*,Kp}$) in quadrature to $E_\mathrm{Kp,flare}$.
%\\
%We derived $\sigma_{ED}$ empirically from the injection and recovery of synthetic flares. It is determined from the standard deviation in correction factors $f_{ir}$ between injected and recovered $ED$. $f_{ir}$ is a function of flare amplitude and duration. Uncetrainties on amplitude and duration are also derived empirically from injection and recovery of synthetic flares.
%\\
%We propagated the uncertainties on $\sigma_L$ from uncertainties on photometry, extinction correction, and empirical color$-T_\mathrm{eff}$ relations~\citep{mann_erratum_2016} for which the photometry was used. Uncertainties on the stellar radius were obtained from $T_\mathrm{eff} - R_*$ relations~\citep{mann_erratum_2016}. Both, color$-T_\mathrm{eff}$ and $T_\mathrm{eff} - R_*$ relations, included the uncertainties on [Fe/H] that we collected from the literature.
%HOW ARE THEY DISTRIBUTED?
\subsection{Power law fits}
\label{powerlawfits}
Flare frequency distributions (FFDs) follow power law relations that cover several orders of magnitude, from solar microflares to stellar superflares. In the cumulative distribution the frequency $f(>E)$ of flares above a certain energy $E$ is
\begin{equation}
f(>E) = \dfrac{\beta}{\alpha - 1}E^{-\alpha + 1},
\label{eqn:cumdist}
\end{equation}
and analogously, for $ED$~\citep{gershberg1972}. We used and compared two approaches to fitting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to the data. The first was a Modified Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MMLE) for power law distributions~\citep{maschberger_powerlaw_2009}. The second approach was more specifically tailored to flaring activity. We used the MCMC method to sample from the predictive distribution for a flare source that produced flares that followed a Poisson process in time, and are power law distributed in the ensemble \citep{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004}. While the MMLE was computationally efficient and was useful to obtain first results~(see Appendix~\ref{sec:app:MMLE}), only the predictive distribution allowed us to fit for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ simultaneously, and determine their uncertainties.
\\
We adopted the model described in \citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004}. Following their derivation, we defined the joint posterior distribution for the probability $\epsilon$ that a flare with $ED$ or $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ above some value $S_2$ would occur within a time period $\Delta T$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{joint_posterior}
p(\epsilon, \alpha) &=& C \cdot\, (-\ln(1 - \epsilon)^{M})\nonumber\\
                    && \cdot\, (\alpha-1)^M \cdot\, \Gamma(\alpha) \left[\dfrac{(S_2 / S_1)^{M+1}}{\pi} \right]^{\alpha}\nonumber\\
                    && \cdot\, (1-\epsilon)^{(T / \Delta T) \,\cdot\, (S_2 /S_1)^{\alpha-1} -1 }.
\end{eqnarray}
$C$ was the normalisation constant, $M$ was the number of events, $T$ the total observation time. $\Gamma$ contained the prior distribution for $\alpha$, and $S_1$ denoted the detection threshold above which all flares were detected. $\pi$ encapsulated the flare energies as
\begin{equation}
    \pi = \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^M \dfrac{s_i}{S_1},
\end{equation}
where $\{s_1,s_2,...s_m\}$ were the flare energies $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ or $ED$.
\\
The posterior distribution in \citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004} captured both the Poissonian distribution of flare events in time, and their power law distribution in energy, simultanesously. The authors derived this model to be able to predict the flaring rate above a given energy for any active region on the Sun, and offered an extension to Eq. \ref{joint_posterior} that treated changing flaring activity rates as the active region evolves, and also characteristics of the active region itself, such as sunspot classifiers. In the above simplification of the model, we assumed that the flare generating process did not change within the observation time span in any star in our sample ($M=M'$ in Eq. 24 in \citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004}). Another assumption was that this process was the same for all stars in the sample ($\Lambda_{MC}=1$ in aforementioned Eq. 24). Under these assumptions the samples of flares found in the light curves of different stars and light curves obtained during different campaigns could be stacked together.
\\
From the posterior distribution of $\epsilon$ we derived $\beta$ by combining Poisson statistics 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = 1 - \mathrm{e}^{(-f\cdot\Delta T)}
\label{poissonstats}
\end{equation}
and the cumulative power law function in Eq. \ref{eqn:cumdist}:
\begin{equation}
\beta = - \dfrac{\ln(1 - \epsilon)\cdot (\alpha -1)}{\Delta T} \cdot S_2^{\alpha -1}
\label{eqn:epstobeta}
\end{equation}
%With a uniform prior for $\alpha$ the results from the MLE and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior distribution are the same, the latter allowed us to fit for $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$ simultaneously. Additionally, the MCMC approach can be extended to incorporate further information about the stars in the sample in the future.
%\\
With a uniform prior for $\alpha$ the results from the MLE and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior distribution were consistent within uncertainties~(see Appendix \ref{sec:app:MMLE}). However, the MCMC method allowed us to fit for both $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$ simultaneously, and to use more informative priors. 
\\
The power law exponent determined for flare frequency distributions has consistently been found to be independent of age~\citep{davenport2019}, and spectral type for solar-type and low mass dwarfs~(see Fig. \ref{fig:powerlaw_literature} in Appendix \ref{sec:app:universal_alpha}). We chose our prior to reflect this result: 
%The studies we took into account analysed flare frequency distributions of stellar flares in the optical regime, and focused mostly on K and M dwarfs~\citep{lurie_kepler_2015, howard_evryflare_2019, lacy_uv_1976, shakhovskaya_stellar_1989} or ultra-cool dwarfs~\citep{gizis_k2_2017} but also solar-type stars~\citep{shibayama_superflares_2013}. 
Starting from a uniform prior for $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$, we found a Gaussian distribution to be an excellent fit to the posterior distribution for $\alpha$ for the full sample of flares in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space. We then used this Gaussian distribution as a prior for the FFDs in individual age and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins. 
%The MLE from \citet{bauke_powerlaw_2007} breaks when the distribution is too flat. Then the log-Likelihood cannot be computed because it contains the Hurwitz-Ceta function, which is not defined for $\alpha \leq 1$. When both converge, the second and the third method give consistent results within uncertainties. THIS COULD BE SOLVED BY A NUMERICAL TRICK TO DEAL WITH BAD VALUES IN THE LOGLIKELIHOOD.
%\\
%The uncertainties on $\alpha$ were computed using the jackknife algorithm, which is well suited if we suspect false positives among the flare candidates. The resulting uncertainty estimate reflects the weight of outliers in the data. To show this, we sampled 100 random FFDs of the same size, best fit power law parameters, and minimum and maximum observed $ED$ for each power law fit we performed. We compared the power law parameters derived for these FFDs with the above methods to the original value, and found that the jackknife uncertainty captures XX\% of random FFDs' results. With all methods, we fitted the intercept $\beta_\mathrm{cum}$ using non-linear least squares to the cumulative FFD and converted the result to $\beta = \beta_\mathrm{cum}\cdot|\alpha-1.|$. As with $\alpha$, we calculated the uncertainty $\sigma_{\beta_\mathrm{cum}}$ using the jackknife algorithm, and propagated uncertainties from $\alpha$ for the final result on $\beta$.
%\\
% Additionally we calculated the exceedance statistic $tr$ to test if the power law distribution was truncated. If $tr$ is 1, the power law distribution is truncated at the high energy end. If $tr$ is 0, no information was gained from the calculation. To derive $tr$, given a number $n$ of observations $X_{n}$ and a best fit value for the power law exponent, we generated 500 samples with $n$ values from this best-fit distribution assuming no truncation, i.e. choosing an upper limit several orders of magnitude higher than $X_{max}$. We then proceeded to truncate the samples at thresholds $T$ below the maximum observed value $X_{max}$ and determined the average number $N_{ex}$ of generated values that will exceed $T$. If the underlying power law is not truncated, $N_{ex}$ declines with larger $n$, as larger $X_{max}$ will be present in the original data. If the best fit power law exponent is steeper, $N_{ex}$ will be underestimated. If the best fit power law exponent is flatter, $N_{ex}$ will be overestimated. If the power law is not truncated, for $n>=100$ $N_{ex}/n$ will be $< 5\%$, for $20<n<100$, typically $N_{ex}/n < 15\%$.

The core objective of this work was to quantify how the previously noted decline in flaring activity with age would unfold for different spectral types. To this end, we searched the long cadence light curves of stars across a broad range of spectral types in five different open clusters for flares, and measured their energies and occurrence rates. We found \input{values/total_number_of_flares.txt} flares. We fitted power law relations to the flare frequency distributions (FFD) of samples of stars for each cluster, that is, broken down by age, and for a set of effective temperature bins, that is, broken down by spectral type. We found that flaring activity decreased with increasing age from ZAMS to 3.6 Gyr, and from mid-M to G dwarfs. Except for the stars in the coolest temperature bin (M5.5-M8, 2\,500-3\,000 K), stellar flaring activity at a given age was higher for cooler stars.

\subsection{Flare frequency distributions}
We fitted power law parameters for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to the full sample FFDs in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space by sampling from the joint posterior distibution in Eq. \ref{joint_posterior}. We chose uninformative priors for both $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$. 
\\
The detection threshold in any FFD was not a unique function of $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ or $ED$, but depends on the flares' amplitudes and durations. Since it was computationally not feasible to perform the injection of synthetic flares to determine the effect of K2SC de-trending, we could not correct for the incompleteness of flare detection at the low energy end. To a first approximation to a detection threshold, we chose to use only the portion of the FFD for the fit, where all flaring stars contribute, that is where all contributing stars will have exceeded the detection threshold. This mitigated but did not solve the problem of a detection probability $<1$ that still affected the shape of the FFDs at the lower energy end. We could not exclude even more flares on the low-energy end because it would have given increasing weight to the high-energy tail naturally suffered from low numbers of flares. In the case of the full sample we expected that for some stars the high-energy threshold would be reached at some energy below the maximum detected energy in the sample. Consequently the high-energy tail of the FFD would also be incomplete. To arrive at consistency with a powerlaw at a 5\% significance level using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov as suggested by~\citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004} by choosing ever higher low-energy cutoffs, we would have had to exclude the majority of flares. The power law exponent in these cases would have approached $\alpha\sim 2.4$ (using only about 320 flares out of \input{values/total_number_of_flares.txt}). The absolute value of $\alpha$ obtained in this study had to be interpreted under these circumstances. It remained useful as a relative anchor for the comparison within the sample assuming that the FFDs for different age and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins suffered from the same incompletenesses.
\\
We fitted a Gaussian distribution to the posterior distribution for $\alpha$ from the full sample and used it as a prior for the power law fits to the FFDs in the individual bins. The values for the full sample FFDs in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space~(Fig. \ref{fig:powerlawfit_full}) are summarized in Table \ref{tab:powerlawtable_fullsample}. 
\\
The core part of this work was to investigate the effects of age on the flaring activity for low mass stars. We therefore split up the full sample into $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins and constructed the FFDs cluster by cluster~(Figs. \ref{powerlawfits_s}, and \ref{powerlawtable_spt}). The power law fit parameters to these FFDs are summarized in Table \ref{tab:powerlawtable_spt}. Relative flaring activity levels were best described by $\beta_s$, the power law fit intercept for the FFDs in $ED$ space. It accounted for the different energy budgets of stars, by looking at the relative flare energies as measured by $ED$ as opposed to $\beta_\mathrm{erg}$ which was based the Kepler band flare energy $E_\mathrm{Kp}$, and mostly reflected the influence of the absolute stellar energy budget. We could therefore use $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ to compare across both $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and age. Overall, $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ declined with age in all investigated $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins but the $2500-3000$ K bin, where it increased from ZAMS to Hyades age~(Fig. \ref{fig:beta_T_age}). This reverse was also present in a K2 short cadence K7-M6 dwarf flaring study~\citep{raetz2020}. In the lowest mass bin (M5-M6) the authors measured higher flaring activity for relatively slow rotators ($P_\mathrm{rot} > 2\,$d) than for their fast counterparts ($P_\mathrm{rot} < 2\,$d).

%-------------------------------------------
\subsection{$\beta_\mathrm{s}$}
We can compare the flaring activity across masses and ages using $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ ($R_\mathrm{1s}$ in \citealt{davenport2019}). $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ is the power law intercept derived from the FFD in $ED$ space. It allows us to control for the total energy budget of the star that would otherwise dominate $\beta$ by dividing flaring energies by stellar luminosity, that is, using $ED$ instead of $E_\mathrm{Kp}$. Fig. \ref{fig:beta_T_age} presents a synthesis of the FFDs presented in Fig. \ref{fig:powerlawfits_s}. 
\\
\citet{lurie2015} analysed the flares on GJ 1245 A and B, two M5 dwarfs in a triple system with another M8 dwarf, that were observed in 1-min cadence during the original Kepler mission. GJ 1245 A and B both fell roughly into the $3000-3250\,$K bin. From their FFDs and fitted values for $\alpha$ for each component we inferred $\beta_\mathrm{s,A}\approx 1900\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$  and $\beta_\mathrm{s,B}\approx 2200\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, consistent with $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ for the Pleiades, or Hyades/Praesepe within uncertainties.
%-------------------------------------------
\subsection{Flaring luminosity $FA$}
The energy released in flares was inferred using our derived stellar luminosities. It declines with age for every $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bin considered for both the total luminosity and relative to the quiescent flux~(Fig. \ref{agemass_FA_Lflare}).
\\
$L_\mathrm{Kp,flare}$ is the luminosity in flares in the Kepler band. We can relate this to the quiescent bolometric luminosity of the star when we define the fractional flare luminosity $FA$ in analogy to \citetalias{ilin_flares_2019}:
\begin{align}
\label{FA}
FA&=\dfrac{E_\mathrm{Kp,flare,tot,}}{t\cdot L_{\mathrm{bol,*,}}}
\end{align}
We determined $L_\mathrm{bol,*}$ from $R_*$ and $T_\mathrm{eff}$, as described in Sec.~\ref{TeffRL}. In Fig. \ref{fig:FA} we computed the median and standard deviation $FA$ for every $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bin. $FA$ is a meaningful measure of relative stellar activity as long as the flux portion of the quiescent star in the Kepler band is roughly constant. It is therefore more meaningful to compare $FA$ values across age than across $T_\mathrm{eff}$.

    \label{fig:FA}
\end{figure*}
%---------------------------------------------

\subsection{Hyades and Praesepe}
We expected the flaring activity in the Hyades and Praesepe to be very similar because they were nearly coeval clusters with ages around 700 Myr, and comparable metallicities ([Fe/H](Praesepe)\,$=0.16$, [Fe/H](Hyades)\,$=0.13$,~\citealt{netopil_metallicities_2016}). We found this reflected in all our FFDs, except for the $3500-3750$\,K temperature bin, where the Hyades appeared almost as active as the Pleiades (135 Myr). This discrepancy could be explained by the rotation period distributions of their samples. In all other temperature bins the rotation period distributions of the Hyades and Praesepe were similar, while the Pleiades showed shorter periods on average. In the $3500-3750$\,K temperature bin, the rotation periods found in the Hyades and the Pleiades were more alike than in the Hyades and Praesepe (see Fig. \ref{fig:rotation_histogram} in the Appendix). In this temperature regime, the overwhelming majority of Praesepe stars had rotation periods above 10\,d, while in the Hyades and the Pleiades rotation periods were more evenly distibuted in the $0.3-30$\,d range.

We found several flare candidates in members of M67 and Rup 147. But upon close inspection all but the events that occurred on four stars either turned out to be false positives, or multiple systems, or evolved stars. Most flare candidates in these old clusters were detected on RS CVn binaries, cataclysmic binaries, Algol type binaries, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and red giant stars. Excluding all these, we were left with one flare in M67 on a K1 dwarf. In Rup 147, we narrowed down the list to a flare on a G8 star in Rup 147, and four flares each on a K0.5 and an M3 star. For these stars, the multiplicity status was unknown. We found that the mass range of these stars as calculated from the uncertainties on their radii~\citep{eker2018} was large enough that the four stars in question could in principle be binary stars with undetected mid-M dwarf companions~(Table \ref{tab:m67_rup147_binaries}). After the manual inspcetion of the younger clusters we concluded that, while binaries and false positives were present in these clusters also, they were not the dominating source of flares. As multiplicity rates for low-mass stars decrease from about 50\% for F type stars~\citep{raghavan_multiplicity_2010} to 22\% for L and T dwarfs~\citep{duchene_multiplicity_2013}, with M dwarf having somewhat higher multiplicity rates at about 27\%~\citep{winters2019}, we expect that the error introduced by unresolved binaries on our results was smaller for the cooler $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%-------------------------------------------
The launch of the Kepler satellite in 2009 caused a surge in statistical flare studies, a trend that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will continue and expand. Comparing our results with these works~\citep{shibayama2013,lurie2015,lin2019,raetz2020} and recent ground based surveys~\citep{chang2015,howard2019} we found encouraging consistency but also some noteworthy discrepancies that we could not always trace back to its cause. We found poor agreement between our FFDs and a gyrochronological model recently proposed for its parametrization as a function of mass and age~\citep{davenport2019}. We conclude the discussion with a reflection on the universality of the power law exponent $\alpha$, and on the observational limitations of the representation of FFDs by power law distributions.

%---------------------------------------------


We found our results to be broadly consistent with previous work both on Kepler/K2 data, and ground based surveys in the optical regime, with some noteable exceptions~(Fig. \ref{fig:otherwork}). Overall we believe that the differences in the results were rooted in a combination of astrophysical properties like age, mass and rotation speed, and the influence of selection criteria on the respective samples. 
\\
The flare frequency distributions of two M5 flare stars in a M5-M5-M8 triple system~\citep{lurie2015} were consistent with the FFDs of flares in the Pleiades, Praesepe, and Hyades in the $3000-3250\,$K bin. We also found that the FFDs of nearby K and M dwarfs, observed by Kepler/K2 within 200pc and 100pc, respectively, fell in the range between the Pleiades and Hyades/Praesepe FFDs in our sample~\citep{lin2019}.
\\
The frequency of superflares at $10^{34}$ erg in the most active G-dwarfs and Sun-like stars in Kepler was once in 10–100 days, and every 800 years on average Sun-like stars~\citep{shibayama2013}. Benchmarking on the flare detected on a K1 dwarf in M67 in the G to early K bin (5000-6000 K), and accounting for the fraction of the total flare energy that the Kepler passband covers at a flare temperature of 10 000 K, we found the flaring rate at this energy to amount to about once every 10 years. Doing the same for the Pleiades stars yielded that ZAMS G to K dwarfs flare once in 140 days at $10^{34}$ erg. Young G-K stars therefore corresponded roughly to the active G dwarfs in \citet{shibayama2013} and our solar-age G-K dwarfs appeared more active than in their results.
\\
Photometric flares observed by the MMT 6.5 telescope~\citep{hartman2008} in the $\sim550$ Myr old open cluster M37~\citep{chang2015} appeared on average more active than the Pleiades in our study for spectral types M0-M6. This could imply that flaring activity in these low-mass stars peaked not at Pleiades age but at a later evolutionary stage. \citet{mondrik2019} found evidence of increased flaring activity at intermediate rotation rates between fast and slow sequence~\citep{barnes_rotational_2003}. This measurment could not be recovered in the data obtained from the all-sky EvryFlare survey~\citep{howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}. We found $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ to decrease with age from ZAMS to 700\,Myr for all stars except those with spectral types later than M5~(Fig. \ref{fig:beta_T_age}). But this does not exclude that $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ in fact increases between these two ages before decreasing relatively rapidly within a short period of time.
\\
Similarly, \citet{raetz2020} pointed out that their fast rotating M3.5-M4 dwarfs appeared more active than the results for the Pleiades in \citet{ilin_flares_2019} in the $3250-3750\,$K range. Our revised results remained consistent with \citet{ilin_flares_2019}~(Fig. \ref{fig:otherwork}). Both samples consisted of flares with periods below 10\,d. Rotation periods $P_\mathrm{rot}$ were given for 100\% of the sample in~\cite{raetz2020}, and for $>85\%$ in our respective sub-sample~(see Fig. \ref{fig:rotation_histogram} in the Appendix for the distribution of $P_\mathrm{rot}$). One possible reason for the discrepancy could have been that the M3.5-M4 dwarfs in \citet{raetz2020} targeted stars at a different age than the Pleiades at which the stars of similar rotation speeds show higher flaring activity. Another possible explanation was that the discrepancy arose from the selection effects in the short cadence sample in \citet{raetz2020} as compared to our sample. Targets for short cadence observations in K2 were not selected randomly from the underlying stellar population, but were filtered for a variety of properties that biased the final selection towards peculiarly active stars. A resolution of this discrepancy must also take into account that the results for our Praesepe sample in the  $3250-3750\,$K range were consistent with the slow rotators ($P_\mathrm{rot}\sim32\,$d) in \citet{raetz2020}. 
\\
\citet{howard2019} monitored superflares on cool stars with bolometric energies above $10^{33}$ erg and up to $10^{36}$erg. They found power law exponent values around $\sim 2$ resolved by spectral types. The activity levels for spectral types K5 to M4 are on average lower than in our sample, which could be explained by the overall older age of the stars in their sample. However, they only included stars that exhibited flares (active stars) into their FFDs, whereas we also included the observing time of stars where no flares had been detected into our estimates of occurrence rates. A comparison of the distribution of rotation rates in our sample and the EvryFlare catalog~\citep{howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019} was out of scope for this study.
\subsection{Gyrochronological FFD parametrization}
\citet{davenport2019} derived a parametrization of FFD parameters $alpha$ and $\beta$ as a function of mass and age using the Kepler flare catalog~\citep{davenport_kepler_2016}, rotation periods from~\citet{mcquillan2014}, and the \citet{mamajek2008} gyrochrone model. \textbf{We show the power law fits with given mass and age in Fig. XX alongside our results. It did not predict the observed activity.} The activity level in our sample appeared on average an order of magnitude lower than predicted. A deviation was expected as the model was not designed to predict absolute ages. The authors noted a sample bias in their study towards more active stars. Their model overpredicts the superflaring rate of the average Sun-like sample from~\citet{shibayama2013} and more resembles the rate for their most active sub-sample. Yet the model also failed to predict the relative differences in flaring activity. The gyrochrone model may not map to the underlying rotation-age relation, or the flare sample on which the \citet{davenport2019} model was based was biased, or the OC sample of stars wase either biased or too small and therefore dominated by individual star that were not representative of the ensemble. 
%\subsection{Division at 3000 K}
%The lowest $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bin at Pleiades age in our sample reflects the division between fully convective stars and those with a radiative core~\citep{reid_new_2005}. At this age, the coolest dwarfs may still be accreting angular momentum on the PMS, instead of spinning down on the MS. We suggest that a regime change occurs around 120 Myr for stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}=2500-3250$ K.
%\\
%Below 3000 K, an analysis of 66 ZDI maps show that magnetic field configurations can be strong and dipolar or weak and multipolar~\citep{morin_m4magneticfields_2008, see_zdispindown_2017}. If these stars can be distinguished by age, this should be reflected in our age-resolved flaring activity. If the difference is not a function of age, we should see a similar bimodal distribution of very inactive and very active stars in the lowest mass bins. If the difference between the two configurations is a function of age, we should only see one type of stars with correspondingly similar behaviour in these $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins.
%\\
%The lowest mass bin appears underactive compared to the rest of the flaring-age-$T_\mathrm{eff}$ relation in the $ED$ domain. Physical explanations for this peculiarity include:
%A different magnetic structure
%A truncation of the power law that reflects the maximum $ED$ an active region can produce on these stars.
%\\
%\citet{west_magneticrotationage_2015} found that all M1-M4 dwarfs with rotation periods shorter than 26 days, and all M5-M8 dwarfs with periods shorter than 86 days show H$\alpha$ emission, indicating their magnetic activity.
%\\
%Assuming a typical binary fraction for early and mid M dwarfs~\citep{fischer_multiplicity_1992}, we can expect some of the flares on stars at $T_\mathrm{eff}>3000$ K to belong to unresolved binary companions with $T_\mathrm{eff}<3000$ K. A misattributed flare on an early M dwarf then will be assigned a too small $ED$, but still a correct $E_\mathrm{Kp, flare}$ because the count ratios are equal to the $L_\mathrm{Kp}$ ratios.
\subsection{Universality of $\alpha$}
Taking into account uncertainties and systematic errors resulting power law fitting methods, the power law exponent $\alpha\sim 2$ appeared to be similar for the majority of studies on flare statistics in the literature so far, irrespective of spectral type or age. The values derived for $\alpha$ in our sample were almost precisely $2$ in $ED$ space, and somewhat below $2$ in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$, consistent with previous work~(Fig. \ref{fig:app:powerlaw_literature}). The determination of $\alpha$ usually faces multiple challenges making it difficult to assess whether the spread in $\alpha$ from about $1.4$ to $2.5$ is physically motivated or not. 
\\
In this study, we find that, at both low and high energies, the detection of flares was incomplete. At the low-energy end the detection probability depended on flare duration and amplitude. These parameters were not resolved in FFDs, and while they are correletad there is significant spread in the duration-amplitude relation to blur the cutoff in the FFD. One way to account for this circumstance is to inject and recover synthetic flares with a variety of durations and amplitudes and to determine energy ratios and recovery probabilities for each flare candidate, assuming that the underlying flare shape can be sufficiently well parametrized. This was first explored in~\citet{davenport_kepler_2014} for Kepler data and expanded in~(Schmidt et al. 2020) for TESS. However, GP regression, which was used to de-trend the light curves, was in itself to costly to repeat it hundreds of times for each light curve. 
\\
At the high energy end, the incompleteness is most likely to occur in the full sample FFDs where we expect maximum energy thresholds to be reached for certain spectral types and ages. 
\\
These effects may be partly cancelled by background contamination from, for instance, cosmic rays~\citep{aschwanden_powerlaws_2015}, or solar system objects (SSO). We were also limited by the non-linear dependence for the energy bias from time sampling effects that lead to the severe underestimation of flares energies, as can be observed by comparing flare energies derived for the same flare events from short and long cadence light curves~\citep{yang_flaresampling_2018}. 
%A noteable exception to this rule were A stars observed during the Kepler mission that followed a power law with $\alpha\sim 1$ that may indicate a different physical process~\citep{yang_keplerflares_2019}. 
\subsection{Deviations from single power law}
%\citet{namekata_solarstellarwlf_2017} found conceivable that spots evolve on timescale shorter than the estimated lifetimes. 
Spots can survive on the stellar surface from a few days to nearly a year~
\citep{namekata_solarstellarwlf_2017, davenport_flaresandspots_2015}. Complex spot geometry is correlated with the stongest X-class flares on the Sun~\citep{toriumi_flaresspotssun_2017, sammis_deltaspotsflares_2000}. These observations support the idea that flares are associated with the presence of certain types of starspots, or more generally, certain types of active regions. Since we expect that there is a maximum flare energy a spot can produce, the underlying power law relation must break a some $ED_\mathrm{max}$ in any FFD. We tested a possible truncation of our FFDs using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for consistency with a power law distribution, followed by the exceedance statistic to test for a trucation of this power law as suggested by~\citet{maschberher2009}. While all FFDs with $\geqslant50$ flares were consistent with a power law distribution, we found no evidence for truncation in any of the $T_\mathrm{eff}$-age bins. This would imply that we did not sample the highest possible energies, since much higher relative fluxes than our observed maximum flare amplitudes were observed on other stars~\citep{paudel_monsterucdflare_2018, jackman_superflareucd_2019, schmidt_superflareasassn_2016}.
\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
In this study, we investigated how flaring activity unfolded for different age and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ ranges anchoring the age to the membership of our targets in five open clusters. We found flaring activity as measured by the power law intercept $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ in $ED$ space to decrease from ZAMS to solar age, and from mid M dwarfs to G stars, except for stars later than M5, where activity increased from ZAMS to 690\,Myr.
\\
Using multiple cluster membership studies we selected for high-probability members, and drew from a host of multiband photometry catalogs to determine $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and stellar luminosities. Keeping only targets with well-determined mass and age we proceeded to search \input{values/total_number_of_lcs.txt}K2 long cadence light curves obtained for these stars throughout the K2 mission. We applied the open source software K2SC to remove rotational variability and instrumental effects, and AltaiPony to automatically detect and determine the properties of flare candidates. We vetted all flare candidates manually and discussed various sources of false positives and incompleteness on both the high and the low energy end of the FFDs. We searched \input{values/total_number_of_stars.txt}stars in five open clusters, and found a total of \input{values/total_number_of_flares.txt}flares. Most flares originated in the Pleiades and Praesepe, several hundred were found in the Hyades, a handful in Rup 147, and only one flare candidate appeared on a K1 dwarf in M67.
%As expected, the nearly coeval Hyades and Praesepe yielded consistent FFDs in general. The only exception were stars between 3500 and 3750 K, where the Hyades appeared significantly more active than Praesepe. We were able to trace back this discrepancy to a noteable difference in the distribution of rotation periods in the respective temperature bins, which was not present in the others.
\\
While the FFDs appeared to follow power law distributions, we found no sign of truncation at the high energy end. The power law exponent $\alpha$ was consistent with previous work, and we caution against interpreting apparent trends, especially when comparing across different studies.
\\
We noticed that our results showed lower activity than predicted by a gyrochronological FFD parametrization as a function of mass and age~\citep{davenport2019}, and that the model did not always match the differential decline in age within individual $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins. Although some discrepancies in flaring activity between Praesepe and the Hyades could be traced back to their rotation period distributions, the relation between flaring, rotation, and age awaits further investigation.
\\
Regardless of varying methods employed for flare search and FFD analysis in previous studies we found encouraging consistency in flaring rates with both Kepler and K2 based work, and ground-based surveys. We noticed some differences, which we could not resolve as being either systematic or astrophysical.
\\
Results from the first year of operations of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~\citep{ricker2014} indicate that the light curve quality delivered by the mission so far was well suited for statistical flare studies~\citep{doyle2020,guenther2020}. The expected lifetime of the mission could be up to 20 years, in which case the number of high quality flare samples will soon outclass Kepler and K2 as primary source flares. Not only will the mission vastly expand the treasury of light curves, help us address discrepancies noted in this work adn elsewhere, and pave the road to the use of flaring activity as an age indicator. It will also allow us to probe the flaring activity of the lowest mass dwarfs down into the brown dwarf regime, a realm that could only be scratched by Kepler and K2~\citep{gizis2013, paudel2018}, and remains mostly inaccessible from the ground.
%There are no model-independent stellar ages. It is more correct to speak of evolutionary stage. Stars in open clusters with precise isochronal ages have their observables reduced to a number of years. 
%We can now ask: Can we unambiguously map flaring evolutionary stage to the evolutionary stage of isochronal fit parameters of a given star? If there is either a strong correlation, or even a physical relation between flaring activity and, for instance, mass and rotation rate, the answer is yes. If this relation is sufficiently sensitive to be captured by present day instrumentation, and non-degenerate in the relevant parameters, flaring activity can be integrated into the family of age indicators, and complement and extend them. 
%\\
%Ultimately, flaring activity depends on how efficiently the star converts its energy budget to flares throughout its lifetime. Since the fraction of total luminosity released in flares is small even for the most active stars, this efficiency need not scale directly with the overall energy budget of the star on the MS, but will more likely depend on the ability of the star to use this budget to produce magnetic surface topologies and strengths that enable flaring.
%\\
%A magnetic dynamo, driven by rotation and convection, introduces magnetic field to the system that causes stellar wind that in turn removes angular momentum from the star, decreasing its rotation rate. Over time, the wind takes away more and more angular momentum, and the global magnetic field weakens. This is reflected in observations of chromospheric indicators (ZDI???). The decline is famously known as the Skumanich law, and gave rise to the rotational age-dating technique called gyrochronology. However, recent studies noted deviations from this rule, a stalling of the spin-down, and offered multiple competing explanations. It is not clear how these effects reflect on the small scale surface magnetic field. Chromospheric activity on solar type stars seems to continue to decline regardless of these rotational effects. 
%What about X-ray?
%\\
%Observationally, not much can be directly said about the small scale topology of stellar magnetic fields beyond% extrapolations from the solar case. On the Sun, chromospheric activity indicates line emission in excess of radiative equilibrium that is caused by magnetic fields. Likewise, magnetic field effects heat the corona

\section{Membership probabilities}

To match catalogs on RA and declination we used the \texttt{astroML.crossmatch} tool for Python~\citep{astroML}.
\\
For the studies with classifiers we assigned membership probabilities as follows.
In~\citet{gonzalez_m67mem_2016}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p(M (\text{member}))&=&0.9,\\
p(BM(\text{binary member}))&=&0.9,\\
p(N (\text{non-member}))&=&0.1,\\
p(SN(\text{single non-member}))&=&0.1,\\
p(BN (\text{binary non-member}))&=&0.1,\\
p(U (\text{unknown member}))&=&0.5.
\end{eqnarray*}
In~\citet{curtis_ruprecht_2013}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p(Y (\text{highest confidence member}))=0.9,\\
p(P (\text{possible/probable member}))=0.7,\\
p(N (\text{not likely/non-member}))=0.7,\\
p(B (\text{photometry consistent with blue stragglers}))=0.0.\\
\end{eqnarray*}
In~\citet{rebull_praesepe_2017}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p((\text{best}))=0.9,\\
p((\text{ok}))=0.6,\\
p((\text{else}))=0.1.
\end{eqnarray*}
Members from \citet{rebull_rotation_2016, douglas_poking_2017}; and ~\citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd} were assigned $p=0.9$ if they appeared in the final catalog.
\\
Table \ref{tab:app:memberships} gives an overview over different membership catalogs.

\section{Cluster parameters}
\label{app:cluster_params}
We compiled various age, distance, and metallicity values from the literature for the clusters in this study. Table \ref{tab:app:oc_parameters} shows that most studies independently arrived at similar results for all our clusters. The adopted parameters are emphasized, and were chosen based on consistency with prior work, uncertainties provided with the results and the data used for the study (newer catalogs were preferred).

\section{Broadband photometry: quality cuts and conversions}
\label{sec:app:photometry}
We required \texttt{flux}/\texttt{flux\_error}$ \geq 10$ for Gaia G, BP, and RP bands. We require that the 2MASS measurements for $J$, $H$, and $K$ to be "A". "A" meant that measurements had $S/N>10$ and $\sigma<0.11$. For PanSTARRS photometry, we required that the \texttt{QF\_OBJ\_GOOD} quality filter flag was set. %We required flags 8 or 16 or 32 in the \texttt{gFlags}~(and respective flags for r,i,z, and y) from \texttt{ObjectFilterFlags} to be set for each band. 8 indicates that observation were made on a photometric night. 16 and 32 verify that PS1 photometry was obtained.
SDSS and PS1 \textit{ugrizy} bands were similar but not identical, but could be converted using Table 2 in~\citet{finkbeiner_ps1tosdss_2016}.
%\section{Solar system objects}
%Solar system objects (SSOs) produce brightness excursions in K2 light curves that can closely resemble flare signatures. Often, they can be distinguished by their symmetric rise and decay shape as contrasted with the typical fast-rise gradual decay flare shape~\citep{davenport_kepler_2014}.
%M. H. Christiansen and colleagues developed a routine called \texttt{SkyBoT} that matches positions and times to passages of SSOs listed in YYY. RA, declination, start, stop, and mid epochs of flares in BKJD are the input parameters. We excluded all flare candidates that occurred within X minutes of a SSO passage at the star's position. This procedure removed ZZ\% of all flare candidates. In the case of high energy flares, we confirmed the passage by manually inspecting the pixel file with the \texttt{lightkurve} \texttt{interact} function for TargetPixelFiles.

\section{Modified Maximum Likelihood Estimatator}
\label{sec:app:MMLE}
As a means to arrive at results efficiently, and as consistency check to the method derived from~\citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004} we fitted $\alpha$ to the FFDs in $ED$ and $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ space using a Modified Maximum Likelihood Estimatator (MMLE,~ \citealt{maschberger_powerlaw_2009}). The logarithm of the likelihood function $\mathcal{L}$ that had to be maximized was given by the authors in Eq. (8) in their manuscript:
\begin{equation}
\log \mathcal{L} = n \log (1-\hat{\alpha})-n \log\left(x_\mathrm{max}^{1-\hat{\alpha}}-x_\mathrm{min}^{1-\hat{\alpha}}\right) - \hat{\alpha} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log x_i
\label{eqn:MLE}
\end{equation}
where $x_i$, $x_\mathrm{max}$, and $x_\mathrm{min}$ were the detected flare energies, and the upper and lower limits for detection, respectively. $n$ was the total number of flares. The estimate for $\alpha$ would be biased in practice because the value used for $x_\mathrm{max}$ would be the maximum energy that was measured, and not the underlying upper limit. The stabilization transformation suggested by the authors (Eq. (12) in \citealt{maschberger_powerlaw_2009}) was then applied to the solution for $\alpha$ to account for this bias:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = 1 + \dfrac{n}{n-2}(\hat{\alpha} - 1)
\label{eqn:MLE_stabilize}
\end{equation}
Using the MMLE method on the full sample of flares in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space we obtained $alpha_\mathrm{erg}=$\input{values/MMLE_alpha_energy.txt} and $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=$\input{values/MMLE_alpha_ed.txt}, respectively, indicating a marginally flatter power law than the predictive model ($\alpha_\mathrm{erg}=$\input{values/MCMC_alpha_energy.txt}, $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=$\input{values/MCMC_alpha_ed.txt}).
 %As recommended by \citet{maschberger_powerlaw_2009}, we applied the stabilized Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test at $95\,\%$ significance level to all power law fits in the sample. If the test fails the power law model does not fit the data at the given significance level. If the test passes, this does not give any information whether the power law model is the correct assumption. The goodness of fit can be estimated from the visual inspection of percentile-percentile plots, given in the online material\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ekaterinailin/flares-in-clusters-with-k2-ii}}.

\section{Rotation and flaring}

         \caption{Rotation histograms for the cluster members that were searched for flares and had measured rotation periods $P_\mathrm{rot}$. Rotation periods were taken from~\citet{douglas2019} for the Hyades and Praesepe, and from~\citet{rebull_pleiadesrot_2016} for the Pleiades. Rotation periods were available for $\input{values/min_stars_with_rotation_periods.txt}-\input{values/max_stars_with_rotation_periods.txt}\%$ of the stars that we searched for flares with a median of $\input{values/median_stars_with_rotation_periods.txt}\%$.}
          \label{fig:rotation_histogram}
         % X panel: Power law exponent $\alpha_\mathrm{MK}$, fitting procedure follows Bauke (2007).
   \end{figure*}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------
More energetic flares can be expected from faster rotating stars~\citep{candelaresi_superflare_2014, doorsselaere_stellar_2017, yang_flaring_2017}. However, the famous $~\mathrm{age}^{-1/2}$ Skumanich spin-down law for rotation braking and Ca II depletion as a proxy to magnetic activity~\citep{skumanich1972} was only ever true to a first approximation.
%Findings that flares with intermediate Rossby number appear to flare more than fast and slow rotators~\citep{mondrik_flarerotation_2019} \textbf{could not be reproduced here} or in the EvryFlare survey~\citep{howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}. 
%If enhanced flaring can be interpreted as an increase in the stellar angular momentum loss rate flaring activity can be used to inform the cause of variation in the spin-down efficiency. 
One example of non-linear spin-down was the apparent temporary stalling of spin-down seen in K dwarfs in the 1\,Gyr old open cluster NGC 6811~\citep{curtis2019}. As our results indicate, the decline of flaring activity with age did not follow the Skumanich law across the stellar main sequence life time. Moreover, it depended crucially on $T_\mathrm{eff}$~(see Fig. \ref{fig:beta_T_age}). 
% The authors favored a scenario in which the stellar core transfers momentum onto the envelope but did not rule out the possibility of a decreased magnetic braking efficiency. In the latter scenario, these stars should flare less. %What do Cecilia's models say about the change in MF regime in these stars?
\\
In Fig. \ref{fig:rotation_histogram} we show rotation periods derived from K2 light curves for the Pleiades~\citep{rebull_pleiadesrot_2016}, the Hyades and Praesepe~\citep{douglas2019}, to illustrate the $P_\mathrm{rot}$ distributions that correspond to our $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins at fixed ages.
\section{Universality of $\alpha$}
\label{sec:app:universal_alpha}
We searched the literature for studies work where power laws were fitted to FFDs of flares in the optical regime using different methods~(Fig.~\ref{fig:app:powerlaw_literature}). While most studies consistently find values somewhat above or below $\alpha\approx2$, the comparison reveals unresolved systematic errors in all these studies, including our own, if $\alpha$ is truly universal for all FFDs.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------

   \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{pics/appendix/overview_alpha_literature.png}
         \caption{Literature overview over power law fits to FFDs. Red rectangles indicate the energy range in which flares were detected, and the range of values determined for the power law exponent $\alpha$ including quoted uncertainties and superimposing the ranges for $\alpha$ from multiple FFDs if any. The grey line depicts the superposition of these results, representing each by a Gaussian fit with the range used as standard deviation, and weighted by the square root of the number of flares found in each study. \citealias{ilin2019} and this work are shown with a dashed outline. \citet{lacy_uv_1976} pioneered in statistical flare studies using observations of eight UV Ceti stars. \citet{shakhovskaya_stellar_1989} analyzed monitoring data from several dozen active early K to late M dwarfs in the solar vicinity, the Orion, the Pleiades, the Hyades, and the Praesepe cluster. \citet{hawley_kepler_2014} used flares from M dwarfs in the original Kepler observations for their FFDs. A number of studies focused on solar-type and G dwarfs stars in Kepler~\citep{maehara2012,wu2015,shibayama2013}. \citet{hilton2011} derived $\alpha$ from ground-based observations of M dwarfs. \citet{lurie2015} determined $\alpha$ from Kepler short cadence light curves of two active M5 dwarfs in Kepler. \citet{davenport_kepler_2016} searched the entire Kepler catalog for flares. \citet{yang_flaring_2017} followed up on \citet{davenport_kepler_2016} in searching the entire Kepler catalog for flares. \citet{lin2019} (M) and (K) were based on nearby M and K dwarf flares in K2 long cadence light curves. \citep{raetz2020} studied short cadence M dwarfs with rotation periods in K2. \citet{gizis_k2_2017-1} constructed an FFD for 22 flares on an M7 dwarf. \citet{paudel2018} studied M6-L0 dwarfs in K2 short cadence data. \citet{howard2019} found over 500 superflares on 284 stars in the framework of the Evryscope all-sky survey. Photometric flares were observed by the MMT 6.5 telescope~\citep{hartman2008} in the $\sim550$ Myr old M37 open cluster~\citep{chang2015}. Finally, \citep{guenther2020} took a first look to $\alpha$ as derived from stars observed during TESS Cycle 1. From their work we only use $\alpha$ derived from stars with 20 or more flare detections.
