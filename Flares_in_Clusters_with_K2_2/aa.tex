\section{Introduction}
%The impressive morphology of flares has incited our curiosity for decades. Yet the underlying physical processes are still not fully understood on the Sun, and even less so on other stars.
Flares are explosions on stellar surfaces with a complex spatio-temporal and energetic phenomenology. We know that flares are magnetic re-connection events that lead to a change in field line topology and subsequent energy release~\citep{priest_magnetic_2002}. We can observe flares in nearly all electromagnetic bands, from radio
to X-ray, and on all stars that possess a convection zone, from late F type stars to ultracool dwarfs~\citep{schaefer2000,benz2010,gizis2013}. 
\\
%But even with continuous monitoring at high temporal resolution, the random occurrence of solar flares makes them costly observing targets, especially in coordinated multi-band observations. In integrated light, most solar flares have a far too low contrast and intensity to be observable. 
Stellar flares on cool stars can enhance the optical flux by up to several orders of magnitude within minutes or seconds~\citep{haisch1991}. They typically exhibit blackbody emission at temperatures significantly higher than these stars' photospheres~\citep{hawley1992}. The high intensity and contrast allow us to measure magnetic activity as traced by flares for a broad range of stars.
\\
%With the evidence that the physical processes that cause flares on the Sun and other stars are the same~\citep{karoff_observational_2016}, solar and stellar flares can inform each other~\citep{shibayama_2013}. Inconsistencies in extrapolations from solar to stellar conditions~\citep{Aarnio2011, aarnio_masslosscme_2012, drake_cmemassloss_2013} provide valuable clues to the differences in magnetic properties between Sun and M dwarfs, too~\citep{alvaradogomez_cme_2018}. 
Statistical flare studies have been pioneered from the ground~\citep{lacy_uv_1976}. But it was not until space missions like Kepler~\citep{koch2010} and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~\citep{ricker2014} enabled the investigation of stellar ensembles that were not pre-selected for their activity~\citep{walkowicz2011}. Statistical studies of stellar flaring activity can help us understand the underlying physical processes of flares~\citep{benz2010}, the nature of stellar surface magnetic fields, starspots~\citep{davenport_flaresandspots_2015, howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}, how flares relate to stellar angular momentum evolution~\citep{mondrik2019, howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}, and how they affect the atmospheres of exoplanets~\citep{lecavelier_flareescape_2012, loyd_mflaresplanetsfuv_2018, tilley_repeated_flare_2019, howard2019}.%, and inform galactic archaeology~\citep{hilton2010,howard2019}. %But we also must scrutinize the assumption, and clarify the circumstances under which solar and stellar flares can be related. From G to L
\\
The present study has a focus on the relation between flares and stellar evolution of low-mass stars on the main sequence. To this end, we set out to quatify how flaring activity changes as a function stellar mass and age. 
\\
In main sequence stars, flaring activity is known to increase in intensity down to spectral type M5~\citep{chang2020}, and continue into the ultracool dwarf regime~\citep{schmidt2015, schmidt2016, paudel2018}. In fact, the prototype flare star, UV Ceti, is an M6 dwarf~\citep{kirkpatrick1991}.
Flaring activity decays with age. However, stellar ages can only be determined indirectly. Using galactic latitute as a proxy for age, flaring activity appeared to decline with higher galactic latitude, that is, older age, for M dwarfs~\citep{hilton2010, walkowicz2011, howard2019}. In gyrochronology, fast rotation indicates young age~\citep{barnes_rotational_2003}, and slows down as the star ages. So the relation between rotation and flaring can be used to calibrate a flaring-age relation~\citep{davenport2019}. Chromospheric activity was also explored as an age tracer in the past~\citep{soderblom_chromospheric_1991, pace_chromospheric_2013, lorenzo-oliveira_age-mass-metallicity-activity_2016}.\textbf{ This also suggests that an age calibration of flaring activity is possible because a significant portion of flaring energy is emitted in $H\alpha$~\citep{kowalski2013}.}%Short rotation periods and high magnetic activity measured in H$\alpha$ are strongly correlated~\citep{west_magneticrotationage_2015}. 
\\
While absolute stellar ages are difficult to assess, they can at least be differentially controlled for in coeval groups of stars. Flaring-age studies in binaries showed consistent activity for both components in the majority of targets~\citep{lurie2015, clarke_flare_2018}. Open clusters (OC) are also coeval groups of stars with well-determined ages from isochrones that have been used as a laboratory for flare studies on stars with a fixed age~\citep{mirzoyan1993, chang2015}. \citet{ilin2019}~(hereafter \citetalias{ilin2019}) investigated the flaring activity of late-K to mid-M dwarfs in three OCs, the Pleiades, Praesepe, and M67, using K2 time domain photometry. They analyzed flare frequency distributions (FFDs) broken down by the stars' effective temperatures $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and ages. They found that flaring activity declined both with increasing mass and age, and that the trend was more pronounced for higher mass stars. 
\\
This study aimed to extend the results in \citetalias{ilin2019} to the age of Ruprecht 147 (Rup 147, 2.5 Gyr), and both higher and lower masses than in the previous study. We used the now complete K2 data set, supplemented all three OCs in~\citetalias{ilin2019} with improved versions of already treated light curves in Campaigns 4 and 5, and added light curves from later Campaigns. The light curve catalog, and the determination of cluster membership and effective temperature for the investigated stars are detailed in Section \ref{sec:data}. We used a semi-automated flare finding procedure, described how we estimated flare energies, and how we parametrized the statistical properties of flares in Section \ref{sec:methods}. We present our findings in Section \ref{sec:results}. We placed our results in the context of recent flare studies, and reflected on the power law nature of FFDs in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. Recently, \citet{davenport2019} proposed an empirical parametrization of the flaring-mass-age relation based on FFDs of stars with gyrochronologically determined ages, which we also put to test in the discussion. The summary and conclusions can be found in Section \ref{sec:summary}.
\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
This work is based on K2 30-minute cadence light curves that were provided by the Kepler archives hosted at the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). We used multiband photometry from several all-sky surveys  to assign $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and gathered OC membership information from the literature to estimate the ages. An overview over the cluster sample is presented in Table \ref{tab:data_clusters} and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:OCs}.

\subsection{K2 light curves}
The Kepler~\citep{koch2010} spacecraft finished its follow-up mission K2~\citep{howell_k2_2014} in September 2018, after having completed nearly 20 80-day observing campaigns. Although Kepler and K2 data were already used in more than 2\,400 publications in 2018, the public archive was still considered understudied~\citep{barentsen_retirement_opportunities_2018}. In this spirit we took up the analysis of a total of \input{values/total_number_of_lcs.txt}light curves where each light curve contained up to $80$ uninterrupted days of $30$ min cadence observations in white light~($4,200-9,000\,\mathring{A}$).
\\
As K2 was conducted on the two-wheeled Kepler satellite, it was subjected to substantial drift motion (spacecraft roll,~\citealt{van_cleve_thats_2016}) and had an overall reduced pointing accuracy. To mitigate these effects, various solutions were developed~\citep{vanderburg_k2sff_2014, aigrain_k2sc_2016, luger_everest_2016, luger_everst_2018}. We used the K2 Systematics Correction (\texttt{K2SC}) pipeline~\citep{aigrain_k2sc_2016} with minor modificiations to de-trend the 36th data release of the K2 data products. This data release was final, and included a uniform, global reprocessing of most K2 campaigns using an improved data reduction pipeline\footnote{\url{https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html}}.
\subsection{Open Clusters}
We obtained membership information from multiple catalogs for each OC. We cross-matched these catalogs on RA and declination within 3 arcsec. The resulting target lists were used to search the K2 archive. One part of the membership catalogs provided membership probabilities~\citep{douglas_praesepe_hyades_2014, cantat_gaudin_2018, olivares_pleiades_2018, reino_hyades_2018, gao_m67mem_2018, olivares_ngc6774_2019}. For the other part no probability was quoted~\citep{rebull_rotation_2016, douglas_poking_2017, gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}, or qualitative classifiers were given~\citep{curtis_ruprecht_2013, gonzalez_m67mem_2016,rebull_praesepe_2017}. In the latter cases we assigned approximate probabilities anchored to the set threshold for inclusion into our final sample~(Appendix \ref{app:memberships}). Absence in a catalog did not decrease the likelihood of membership, as each catalog had different selection biases which we did not address in this study. We set the threshold mean membership probability $p$ for a target in our sample to 0.8.
\\
% For the more distant clusters, Ruprecht 147 and M35, we use the mean cluster distance. For the nearby Pleiades, Praesepe, and most importantly the Hyades, we match our targets with Gaia DR2~\citep{gaia_dr2_release_2018} distances, or use mean distances as fallback option. Ages and metallicities are taken from literature, adopting median values when multiple studies were considered, and excluding studies that appear outdated.
We studied flaring activity in the low mass stars in five OCs spanning ages from ZAMS to roughly solar. Table \ref{tab:data_clusters} provides an overview over the final sample of stars and flares. Membership probability histograms of the final sample are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:app:memberships} in Appendix \ref{app:memberships}. A literature overview of age, distance, and metallicity determinations is given in Table \ref{tab:app:oc_parameters} in Appendix \ref{app:cluster_params}.

%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Pleiades}
%age distance citation?
The Pleiades, a nearby ZAMS cluster, was observed in Campaign 4, and treated in \citetalias{ilin2019}. Here, we used 741 reprocessed K2 light curves from this OC, and our methodological improvements to \citetalias{ilin2019} to repeat the analysis. We revisited the members from~\citet{rebull_rotation_2016}, which were used in \citetalias{ilin2019}, and merged the catalog with lists of members determined by~\citet{olivares_pleiades_2018, gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}; and~\citet{cantat_gaudin_2018}.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsubsection{M35}
%age distance citation?
%M35 is a ZAMS cluster 900 pc away, observed during Campaign 0 in K2. We merged membership lists from \citet{cantat_gaudin_2018, gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}; and ~\citet{bouy_messier_2015}. There are only five K2 light curves, but we identified multiple additional members with publicly available\footnote{\url{https://k2.hatsurveys.org/archive/}} light curves obtained from \citet{soares_furtado_m35_2017}. They used an image subtraction technique in the campaign's super stamps, a self flat-fielding de-trending inspired by K2SFF~\citep{vanderburg_k2sff_2014}, and a trend-filtering algorithm developed by \citet{kovacs_tfa_algorithm_2005}. We preferred PSF photometry in cases where both aperture K2 and PSF LCs were available. We took the raw extracted PSF light curves and de-trended them using \texttt{K2SC}.
%AMC extracted 1-4 pixel aperture light curves from superstamps in the M35 field, too. We compared the noise levels between the LCs derived from the few-pixel apertures to the PSF case using the median value of a rolling band standard deviation as an estimate.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Hyades}
%age distance citation?
The Hyades are a 690 Myr old OC that was observed during Campaigns 4 and 13 with K2.  We merged membership tables obtained from \citet{douglas_praesepe_hyades_2014, reino_hyades_2018}; and \citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd} to select 170 high confidence members, of which 9 were observed in both K2 campaigns. 
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Praesepe}
%age distance citation?
Praesepe (750 Myr) is only a little older than the Hyades. The OC was observed during Campaign 5, and was also treated in~\citetalias{ilin2019}. It was observed again during campaigns 16 and 18. We revisited the membership catalog from~\citet{douglas_praesepe_hyades_2014}, and matched it to the members identified in \citet{douglas_poking_2017, rebull_praesepe_2017,cantat_gaudin_2018}; and ~\citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd}. This was the richest sample with over 900 stars and nearly 2000 light curves.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Ruprecht 147}
%age distance citation?
Rup 147 is a 2.5 Gyr old OC observed during Campaign 7 with K2. We used the mean membership probabilities obtained from ~\citet{curtis_ruprecht_2013, cantat_gaudin_2018, olivares_ngc6774_2019}, and~\citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd} to identify the 53 most likely members.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{M67}

M67 is a 3.6 Gyr old OC about 900 pc away. 234 members were observed during campaign 5, 16 and 18. We did not find any flares in M67 in Campaign 5~\citepalias{ilin2019} light curves of members identified by \citet{gonzalez_m67mem_2016}. Campaigns 16 and 18 delivered both additional observations, and new targets to the sample in \citepalias{ilin2019}, yielding almost 500 light curves for this OC. We merged the members from \citet{gonzalez_m67mem_2016} with a recent study based of Gaia DR2 data~\citep{gao_m67mem_2018}.
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Effective temperatures, stellar radii, and luminosities}
\label{TeffRL}
We determined effective temperatures $T_\mathrm{eff}$ using broadband photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey~(2MASS; \citealt{skrutskie_two_2006}), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System \mbox{(Pan-STARRS)} Data Release 1~(PanSTARRS DR1; \citealt{2016arXiv161205560C}), and Gaia Data Release 2~(Gaia DR2; \citealt{gaia2016, gaia2018}). We applied quality cuts to 2MASS, Pan-STARRS DR1, and Gaia DR2 data, as described in Appendix \ref{app:photometry}, and removed foreground stars using Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We corrected the 2MASS and PanSTARRS photometry in M67 and Rup 147 for extinction using the most recent version~\citep{green_bayestar_2019} of the \texttt{dustmaps} package that provides 3D dust maps derived from 2MASS and PanSTARRS photometry together with Gaia distances~\citep{green_dustmaps_2018}. When no Gaia parallax was available we used the cluster median distance instead. If an extinction value was not available for a given star we used the average extinction value of the respective cluster. We accounted for extinction in Gaia $BP$ and $RP$ bands using the reddening $E(B_P-R_P)$ derived from Gaia photometry and parallax from Gaia DR2~\citep{andrae_gaiaapsis_2018}. We dropped targets that were too bright and would saturate the detector (Kepler magnitude $K_\mathrm{p} \leq 9$).
%The latter were obtained using TOPCAT~\citep{Taylor_TOPCAT_2005}\footnote{\url{http://www.star.bristol.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/}}.
\subsubsection{Effective temperatures $T_\mathrm{eff}$}
We applied several methods and color-temperature relations (CTR) to determine robust $T_\mathrm{eff}$~(Figs. \ref{fig:teff_pleiades_hyades_praesepe} and \ref{fig:teff_ngc6774_ngc2682}). We used CTRs from \citet{boyajian_stellar_2013} and \citet{mann_erratum_2016} (erratum to \citealt{mann_how_2015}), $T_\mathrm{eff}$ derived from Gaia DR2 using the StarHorse algorithm~\citep{queiroz_starhorse_2018}, and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ inferred from Gaia DR2 using the Apsis pipeline~\citep{bailerjones_apsis_2013, andrae_gaiaapsis_2018}.
\\
\citet{boyajian_stellar_2013} determined CTRs from a range of interferometrically characterized stars using $g-r$, $g-i$, $g-z$, $g-J$, $g-H$, and $g-K$ colors from SDSS and Johnson magnitudes for A to K stars. Their sample was centered on solar metallicity, so we constained the use of these CTRs to stars with $-0.25<$\,[Fe/H]$\,<0.25$. Following \citet{boyajian_stellar_2013}, we transformed 2MASS $JHK$ to $J-H$, $H-K$, and $J-K$ in the Johnson system from 2MASS to the Bessell-Brett sytem~\citep{carpenter_color_2001}, and from Bessell-Brett to Johnson using the relations in~\citet{bessell_brett_1988}. 
\\
\citet{mann_how_2015} derived CTRs from absolutely calibrated spectra to which they fitted atmospheric models to obtain $T_\mathrm{eff}$. Alternatively, they determined $T_\mathrm{eff}$ from long-baseline optical interferometry measurements using the bolometric flux. They provided transformations for SDSS/2MASS $r-z$ and $r-J$, or Gaia $BP-RP$ where extra information could be added from metallicity or 2MASS $J-H$. The relations in \citet{mann_how_2015} were only valid if metallicity was sufficiently close to solar, which was satisfied for the OCs in this paper~(see Table \ref{tab:data_clusters}). 
\\
We supplemented our estimates with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ estimates from \citet{anders_starhorse_2019} who determined distances, extinctions, and various stellar parameters for 137 million stars in Gaia DR2 using the StarHorse pipeline~\citep{queiroz_starhorse_2018}.
\\
Gaia DR2 published $T_\mathrm{eff}$ for over 160 million sources~\citep{gaia2018}. The typical uncertainty was quoted at 324 K, but it was lower for stars above $\sim$4100 K and below $\sim$6700K, so that we adopt 175 K which is above the quoted root-median-squared error in this $T_\mathrm{eff}$ range~\citep{andrae_gaiaapsis_2018}, and use provided values only in this range.
\\
Empirical CTRs suffer from systematic errors that stem both from the different methods applied, and from sample selection biases. We therefore used several empirical relations in their appropriate ranges to obtain $T_\mathrm{eff}$ from each, and draw a more reliable median value. Targets that were lacking sufficient photometric data to derive $T_\mathrm{eff}$, or that were too hot to be expected to have a convective envelope ($T_\mathrm{eff} \geq 7000\,$K), were removed from the sample. We dropped all targets where the uncertainty on the weighted mean $T_\mathrm{eff}$ was greater than $10\,$\%. Only targets that were assigned a $T_\mathrm{eff}$ were searched for flares.

\subsubsection{Stellar radii}

We used a catalog of empirically characterized stars~\citep{yee_specmatch_2017} and empirical $T_\mathrm{eff}-R_*$ relations derived by~\citet{mann_how_2015,mann_erratum_2016} to obtain $R_*$ from the $T_\mathrm{eff}$ for the stars in our sample (Fig.~\ref{fig:teff_radius}). \citet{yee_specmatch_2017} compiled 404 stars with high-resolution spectra from the literature, and performed their own observations of mid to late K-dwarfs, achieving a coverage of low mass stars from 7000\;K down to 3000\;K. For these stars, the resulting catalog was accurate to 100\;K in
$T_\mathrm{eff}$, 15\;\% in $R_*$, and 0.09\;dex in [Fe/H]. We interpolated between stars from the catalog to our derived $T_\mathrm{eff}$,  and propagated the resulting scatter to the uncertainty in $R_*$ if $T_\mathrm{eff}>3500$ K. For stars with \mbox{$T_\mathrm{eff}< 3500$} K we used $T_\mathrm{eff}-R_*$ relations derived by~\citet{mann_how_2015,mann_erratum_2016}.

\subsubsection{Stellar spectra and luminosities}
\label{sec:lum}
We assigned spectra to our targets from the SpecMatchEmp~\citep{yee_specmatch_2017} and the FlareSpecPhot libraries~\citep{Kirkpatrick2010, Burgasser2007, Burgasser2008, Burgasser2010, Burgasser2004, Cruz2004, Burgasser2006, Rayner2009, Doi2010, Filippazzo2015, Cruz2003, West2011, Bochanski2010,  Bochanski2007, Schmidt2010, schmidt2015, Schmidt2014a, Schmidt2014b, mann_how_2015}. When a spectrum was available for the derived spectral type in FlareSpecPhot, we preferred it over SpecMatchEmp, which was the case for all stars cooler than M0, where we mapped spectral type to effective temperature~\citep{pecaut_intrinsic_2013}. We then combined stellar radii $R_*$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and spectra to projected bolometric luminosities $L_{\mathrm{bol,*}}$, and projected luminosities in the Kepler band $L_{\mathrm{Kp,*}}$~(\citealt{shibayama2013}; \citetalias{ilin2019}}. Uncertainties on $L_{\mathrm{Kp,*}}$ ranged from 9\;\% to 52\;\% with a median value of 17\;\%.
%uncertainties on derived luminosities
%\citet{rabus_discontinuity_2019} found a discontinuity in the Teff-R relation to occur around 0.23 $M_{\odot}$, and a corresponding bimodal distribution of stellar radii from $T_\mathrm{eff}$ between 3200 and 3340 K. Estimates of bolometric luminosity based on $R$ derived from $T_\mathrm{eff}$, even using empirical relations, can then be off by factors of 2 to 6. While estimates of $M_*$ can help lift this degeneracy they are not provided independently in our sample. We would then have to acknowledge the increased uncertainty in the luminosities for the stars that fall in this regime. However, the observed transition is consistent with very low mass stellar models, where it is not a break but a smooth transition in the Teff-R relation caused by the non-linear increase in the core electron degeneracy parameters with decreasing stellar mass~\citep{cassisi_nodiscontinuity_2019}. %can we account for it
\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
We detected flare candidates automatically with the \texttt{AltaiPony} software, and validated them by eye.  %We performed injection recovery on a handful of example light curves to see that de-trending and intrinsic light curve properties smear out the $ED$ recovery with varying distributions that add an uncertainty of about 30\%. 
The flare rates are believed to follow a power law distribution that spans multiple orders of magnitude in energy. We fitted both power law parameters simultaneously using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to sample from the posterior distribution. 
%We tested the best fit parameters with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and probed possible truncation of the power law relation with an exceedance test.
%We attempted to assign recovery probabilities and corrected for sampling effects using injection/recovery tests but the procedure was not scalable due to computational costs.
\subsection{Flare finding}
\label{sec:sec:flarefinding}
We used the open source software \texttt{AltaiPony}\footnote{\url{altaipony.readthedocs.io}} to automatically detect and characterize flares in our sample. The code base relied on \texttt{K2SC}\footnote{\url{github.com/OxES/k2sc}}~\citep{aigrain_k2sc_2016} to remove instrumental and astrophysical variablity from K2 light curves. We did not use the de-trended light curves available in MAST\footnote{\url{archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sc/}}, but used \texttt{K2SC} to de-trend light curves from the re-processed final data release. We clipped outliers at $3\sigma$ iteratively, as compared to the original work, where outliers were clipped at $5\sigma$~\citep{aigrain_k2sc_2016}.
\\
After de-trending, the flare finder algorithm searched for continuous observing periods, defined as being longer than 10 data points at a minimum cadence of 2\;h. All further routines were run on these observing periods. We estimated the scatter in the residual flux using the iterative procedure that~(Schmidt et al. (2020) in prep.) applied to TESS light curves. The finder iteratively clipped excursions from the median value at $3\sigma$. After each iteration, outliers were cut down to the last median value. Either after convergence, or 50 iterations, the resulting median value was adopted. With this median as quiescent flux, we detected all outliers above $3\sigma$. For flare candidates, we required at least three consecutive data points to fullfil the $3\sigma$-criterion. We merged the candidates into single candidate events if they were less than four data points apart. For each candidate, flaring time, amplitude and equivalent duration ($ED$) were returned.
\\
$ED$ is the area between the LC and the quiescent flux, that is, the integrated flare flux divided by the median quiescent flux $F_0$ of the star, integrated over the flare duration~\citep{gershberg1972}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ED}
ED=\displaystyle \int \mathrm dt\, \frac{F_{flare}(t)}{F_0}.
\end{equation}
$ED$ is a quantity independent of calibration and distance that is suited to compare flaring activity on stars where these properties are uncertain. $ED$ describes the time during which the non-flaring star releases as much energy as the flare itself. This time can be shorter or longer than the actual flare duration. 
The uncertainty in $ED$ depended on the light curve noise properties, time sampling, spacecraft roll, and other systematic effects. Moreover, \texttt{K2SC} de-trending and the flare finding procedure introduced additional uncertainty that dominated the photometric noise. 
\\
The Kepler flare sample has shown to be difficult to treat in a fully automated way. Without manual vetting, the event samples remained significantly contaminated~\citep{yang2019}. As K2 was subject to severe technical difficulties, we expected that the contamination would be even higher. Out of \input{values/total_number_of_detections.txt}only \input{values/total_number_of_flares.txt}\unskip could be confirmed. Some light curves could not be de-trended using \texttt{K2SC} alone. Light curves with extreme astrophysical signal like deep transits, rotational modulation on time scales of a few hours or passages of bright solar system objects (SSOs) had to be masked or fitted with an additional sinusoidal component to the \texttt{K2SC}-treated time series. \textbf{Other SSOs mimicked the fast rise and exponential decay shape of flares, and could only be identified using an extension to the Virtual Observatory (VO) tool sky body tracker (SkyBoT, \citealt{berthier2006, berthier2016}). We identified 144 SSOs using SkyBot and visual inspection with \texttt{lightkurve}~\citep{lightkurve2018}, that is \input{values/sso_fraction.txt}of all confirmed flare candidates~(see Appendix \ref{app:skybot}).} A number of light curves were excluded from the flare search because they saturated the detector, or because the target aperture overlapped with broken pixels. Some very faint targets and extreme variables could not be searched because the de-trending did not terminate successfully. The online version of the final flare sample (Table~\ref{tab:flares}) includes explanatory flags and notes on the excluded targets. 
\subsection{Kepler flare energies}
Multiband time-resolved observations of active M dwarfs have shown that continuum flux accounts for the majority  of the energy radiated by flares~\citep{kowalski_time-resolved_2013}. %also Halwey+2003,  Osten/Wolk2015 (see Loyd+2018, 4.1)
The effective temperature of this blackbody, however, varies:
While solar flares are relatively cool, with \mbox{$T_\mathrm{eff}\approx5\,000-7\,000 $\;K}~\citep{kleint_solarstellarwlf_2016, kerr_solarstellarwlf_2014, watanabe_solarstellarwlf_2013, namekata_solarstellarwlf_2017}. Most stellar events emit in the blue, and exhibit temperatures of about $9\,000-10\,000$\;K~\citep{1992ApJS...78..565H, kretzschmar_sun_2011, davenport_multi-wavelength_2012, shibayama2013}. However, at least one M dwarf flare reached $40\,000$\;K as seen in FUV spectra~\citep{froning_40000_2019}.
%What will be the effect of Tflare on the Kepler band? (calculated in Cluster Analysis notebook 21)
A dependence of flare temperature on stellar age, or mass, or both, will enter our analysis if we quantify bolometric flare energy. At about $6\,200$\;K, the Kepler pass band captures the largest flux fraction, at $10\,000$\;K $72\,\%$, at $40\,000$\,K only $4\%$ of this value is transmitted. 
Given the uncertainties on stellar luminosity in the Kepler band (see Sec. \ref{sec:lum}) and on $ED$, the resulting flare energies~(\citetalias{ilin2019})
\begin{equation}
E_\mathrm{Kp} = L_\mathrm{Kp,*} \cdot ED
\end{equation}  
will substantially deviate from the true released energy. If these uncertainties did not affect all flares in a similar fashion, the present analysis will have suffered from non-uniform biases that affected the flare frequency distributions on stars of different ages and temperatures, and skewed the flare distributions within each subsample. However, the comparison to other studies (see Sec. \ref{sec:consistency_other_work}) suggested that our results were mostly consistent with studies based on similar data~(see Fig. \ref{fig:otherwork}, and \citealt{lin2019} therein for an example), although they used different methods to infer $E_\mathrm{flare}$.  

\subsection{Power law fits}
\label{powerlawfits}
Flare frequency distributions (FFDs) follow power law relations that cover several orders of magnitude, from solar microflares to stellar superflares~(see Fig. 9 in \citealt{shibayama2013}). In the cumulative distribution the frequency $f(>E)$ of flares above a certain energy $E$ is
\begin{equation}
f(>E) = \dfrac{\beta}{\alpha - 1}E^{-\alpha + 1},
\label{eqn:cumdist}
\end{equation}
and, analogously, for $ED$~\citep{gershberg1972}. We used and compared two approaches to fitting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to the data. The first was a Modified Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MMLE) for power law distributions~\citep{maschberger2009}. The second approach was more specifically tailored to flaring activity. \textbf{We used the MCMC method to sample from the predictive distribution for a source that produced flares that followed a Poisson process in time. These flares' energies were also required to be power law distributed by the model}~\citep{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004}. While the MMLE was computationally efficient and was useful to obtain first results~(see Appendix~\ref{sec:app:MMLE}), only the predictive distribution allowed us to fit for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ simultaneously, and determine their uncertainties.
\\
The posterior distribution in \citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004} captured both the Poissonian distribution of flare events in time, and their power law distribution in energy, simultanesously. The authors derived this model to be able to predict the flaring rate above a given energy for any active region on the Sun including changes in flaring activity rates as the active region evolves, and also characteristics of the active region itself, such as sunspot classifiers. In our simplification of the model, we assumed that the flare generating process did not change within the observation time span in any star in our sample ($M=M'$ in Eq. 24 in \citealt{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004}). Another assumption was that this process was the same for all stars in the sample ($\Lambda_{MC}=1$ in aforementioned Eq. 24). Under these assumptions the samples of flares found in the light curves of different stars and light curves obtained during different campaigns could be stacked together. With these simplifications to Eq. 24, we defined the joint posterior distribution for the probability $\epsilon$ that a flare with $ED$ or $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ above some value $S_2$ would occur within a time period $\Delta T$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{joint_posterior}
p(\epsilon, \alpha) &=& C \cdot\, (-\ln(1 - \epsilon)^{M})\nonumber\\
                    && \cdot\, (\alpha-1)^M \cdot\, \Gamma(\alpha) \left[\dfrac{(S_2 / S_1)^{M+1}}{\pi} \right]^{\alpha}\nonumber\\
                    && \cdot\, (1-\epsilon)^{(T / \Delta T) \,\cdot\, (S_2 /S_1)^{\alpha-1} -1 }.
\end{eqnarray}
$C$ was the normalisation constant, $M$ was the number of events, $T$ the total observation time. $\Gamma$ contained the prior distribution for $\alpha$, and $S_1$ denoted the detection threshold above which all flares were detected. $\pi$ encapsulated the flare energies as
\begin{equation}
    \pi = \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^M \dfrac{s_i}{S_1},
\end{equation}
where $\{s_1,s_2,...s_m\}$ were the flare energies $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ or $ED$.
\\
From the posterior distribution of $\epsilon$ we derived $\beta$ by combining Poisson statistics 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = 1 - \mathrm{e}^{(-f\cdot\Delta T)}
\label{poissonstats}
\end{equation}
and the cumulative power law function in Eq. \ref{eqn:cumdist}:
\begin{equation}
\beta = - \dfrac{\ln(1 - \epsilon)\cdot (\alpha -1)}{\Delta T} \cdot S_2^{\alpha -1}
\label{eqn:epstobeta}
\end{equation}
%With a uniform prior for $\alpha$ the results from the MLE and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior distribution are the same, the latter allowed us to fit for $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$ simultaneously. Additionally, the MCMC approach can be extended to incorporate further information about the stars in the sample in the future.
%\\
With a uniform prior for $\alpha$ the results from the MMLE and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior distribution were consistent within uncertainties~(see Appendix \ref{sec:app:MMLE}). However, the MCMC method allowed us to fit for both $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$ simultaneously, and to use more informative priors. 
\\
The power law exponent determined for flare frequency distributions has consistently been found to be independent of age~\citep{davenport2019}, and spectral type for solar-type and low mass dwarfs~(see Fig. \ref{fig:app:powerlaw_literature} in Appendix \ref{sec:app:universal_alpha}). We chose our prior to reflect this result: 
%The studies we took into account analysed flare frequency distributions of stellar flares in the optical regime, and focused mostly on K and M dwarfs~\citep{lurie_kepler_2015, howard_evryflare_2019, lacy_uv_1976, shakhovskaya_stellar_1989} or ultra-cool dwarfs~\citep{gizis_k2_2017} but also solar-type stars~\citep{shibayama_superflares_2013}. 
Starting from a uniform prior for $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$, we found a Gaussian distribution to be an excellent fit to the posterior distribution for $\alpha$ for the full sample of flares in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space. We then used this Gaussian distribution as a prior for the FFDs in individual age and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins. 
%The MLE from \citet{bauke_powerlaw_2007} breaks when the distribution is too flat. Then the log-Likelihood cannot be computed because it contains the Hurwitz-Ceta function, which is not defined for $\alpha \leq 1$. When both converge, the second and the third method give consistent results within uncertainties. THIS COULD BE SOLVED BY A NUMERICAL TRICK TO DEAL WITH BAD VALUES IN THE LOGLIKELIHOOD.
%\\
%The uncertainties on $\alpha$ were computed using the jackknife algorithm, which is well suited if we suspect false positives among the flare candidates. The resulting uncertainty estimate reflects the weight of outliers in the data. To show this, we sampled 100 random FFDs of the same size, best fit power law parameters, and minimum and maximum observed $ED$ for each power law fit we performed. We compared the power law parameters derived for these FFDs with the above methods to the original value, and found that the jackknife uncertainty captures XX\% of random FFDs' results. With all methods, we fitted the intercept $\beta_\mathrm{cum}$ using non-linear least squares to the cumulative FFD and converted the result to $\beta = \beta_\mathrm{cum}\cdot|\alpha-1.|$. As with $\alpha$, we calculated the uncertainty $\sigma_{\beta_\mathrm{cum}}$ using the jackknife algorithm, and propagated uncertainties from $\alpha$ for the final result on $\beta$.
%\\
% Additionally we calculated the exceedance statistic $tr$ to test if the power law distribution was truncated. If $tr$ is 1, the power law distribution is truncated at the high energy end. If $tr$ is 0, no information was gained from the calculation. To derive $tr$, given a number $n$ of observations $X_{n}$ and a best fit value for the power law exponent, we generated 500 samples with $n$ values from this best-fit distribution assuming no truncation, i.e. choosing an upper limit several orders of magnitude higher than $X_{max}$. We then proceeded to truncate the samples at thresholds $T$ below the maximum observed value $X_{max}$ and determined the average number $N_{ex}$ of generated values that will exceed $T$. If the underlying power law is not truncated, $N_{ex}$ declines with larger $n$, as larger $X_{max}$ will be present in the original data. If the best fit power law exponent is steeper, $N_{ex}$ will be underestimated. If the best fit power law exponent is flatter, $N_{ex}$ will be overestimated. If the power law is not truncated, for $n>=100$ $N_{ex}/n$ will be $< 5\%$, for $20<n<100$, typically $N_{ex}/n < 15\%$.

%----------------------------------------
The core objective of this work was to quantify how the previously noted decline in flaring activity with age would unfold for different spectral types. To this end, we searched the long cadence light curves of stars across a broad range of spectral types in five different OCs for flares, and measured their energies and occurrence rates. \textbf{We found \input{values/total_number_of_flares.txt}\unskip flares in five OCs for $T_\mathrm{eff}$ between 2500 K and 6000 K. The flares' amplitudes $a$, start and end cadence numbers $c_0$ and $c_1$, $ED$, energies $E_\mathrm{Kp}$, along with the stars' EPIC ID, $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and bolometric and Kepler band luminosities $L_{bol,*}$ and $L_\mathrm{Kp,*}$ are listed in Table \ref{tab:flares}. We fitted power law relations to the flare frequency distributions (FFD) of stars binned by age, and $T_\mathrm{eff}$~(Figs. \ref{fig:powerlawfits_s}, \ref{fig:powerlawfits_erg} and Table \ref{tab:powerlawtable_spt})}. We found that flaring activity decreased with increasing age from ZAMS to 3.6 Gyr, and from mid-M to G dwarfs. Except for the stars in the coolest temperature bin (M5.5-M8, 2\,500-3\,000 K), stellar flaring activity at a given age was higher for cooler stars.
%------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Flare frequency distributions}
We fitted power law parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (Eq.~\ref{eqn:cumdist}) to the full sample FFDs in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space by sampling from the joint posterior distibution (Eq. \ref{joint_posterior}), where we chose uninformative priors for both $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$. 
The detection threshold in any FFD was not a unique function of $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ or $ED$, but depended on the flares' amplitudes and durations. Since it was computationally not feasible to perform the injection and recovery of synthetic flares to determine the effect of \texttt{K2SC} de-trending, we could not correct for the incompleteness of flare detection at the low energy end. Our approximation to the detection threshold was to use only the portion of the FFD for the fit, where all flaring stars contributed. For the full sample fits~(Fig.~\ref{fig:powerlawfit_full}) we doubled this energy threshold. This mitigated but did not solve the problem of a detection probability $<1$ that still affected the shape of the FFDs at the lower energy end. We did not exclude even more flares on the low-energy end because it would have given increasing weight to the high-energy tail naturally suffered from low numbers of flares. In the case of the full sample we expected that for some stars the high-energy threshold would be reached at some energy below the maximum detected energy in the sample. The co-adding of flare samples from stars of vastly different activity levels aggravated the high-energy incompleteness. Consequently the high-energy tail of the FFD was also incomplete. 
%To arrive at consistency with a powerlaw at a 5\% significance level using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov as suggested by~\citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004} by choosing ever higher low-energy cutoffs, we would have had to exclude the majority of flares. The power law exponent in these cases would have approached $\alpha\sim 2.4$ (using only about 320 flares out of \input{values/total_number_of_flares.txt}). 
The absolute value of $\alpha$ obtained in this study should be interpreted in light of these limitations. It remained useful as a relative anchor for the comparison within the sample assuming that the FFDs for different age and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins suffered from the same incompletenesses.
\\
We fitted a Gaussian distribution to the posterior distribution for $\alpha$ from the full sample. The values for the full sample FFDs in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space~(Fig. \ref{fig:powerlawfit_full}) are summarized in Table \ref{tab:powerlawtable_fullsample}. \textbf{In the table, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the power law parameters from Eq.~\ref{eqn:cumdist}. The number of flares $n_\mathrm{tot}$ in the distribution is higher than the number $n_\mathrm{fit}$ of flares used to fit the power law because we omitted the low-energy tail of the distribution.}
\\
The core part of this work was to investigate the effects of age on the flaring activity for low mass stars. We therefore split up the full sample into $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins and constructed the FFDs cluster by cluster~(Figs. \ref{fig:powerlawfits_s} and \ref{fig:powerlawfits_erg}). \textbf{The full sample posteriors for $\alpha$ were then used as priors for the power law fits to the FFDs in the individual bins. The power law fit parameters to these FFDs, broken down by cluster and $T_\mathrm{eff}$, are summarized in Table \ref{tab:powerlawtable_spt}. The indices s and erg to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ indicate the fits to the FFDs in $ED$ and $E_\mathrm{Kp}$, respectively. $n$ is the number of flares detected in each $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bin. }

\subsection{$\beta_\mathrm{s}$}
Relative flaring activity levels were best described by $\beta_s$, the power law fit intercept for the FFDs in $ED$ space  ($R_\mathrm{1s}$ in \citealt{davenport2019}). Because of the definition of $ED$ (Eq. \ref{eq:ED}) $\beta_s$ is a measure of flaring activity in which the different energy budgets of stars are controlled for. We could therefore use $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ to compare across both $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and age at the same time. Fig. \ref{fig:beta_T_age} can also be interpreted as a synthesis of the FFDs presented in Fig. \ref{fig:powerlawfits_s}. Overall, $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ declined with age in all investigated $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins but the $2500-3000$ K bin, where it increased from ZAMS to Hyades age. This reverse was also present in a K2 short cadence K7-M6 dwarf flaring study~\citep{raetz2020}. In the lowest mass bin (M5-M6) the authors measured higher flaring activity for relatively slow rotators ($P_\mathrm{rot} > 2\,$d) than for their fast counterparts ($P_\mathrm{rot} < 2\,$d).  
\\
\citet{lurie2015} analysed the flares on GJ 1245 A and B, two M5 dwarfs in a triple system with another M8 dwarf, that were observed in 1-min cadence during the original Kepler mission. GJ 1245 A and B both fell roughly into the $3000-3250\,$K bin. From their FFDs and fitted values for $\alpha$ for each component we inferred $\beta_\mathrm{s,A}\approx 1900\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$  and $\beta_\mathrm{s,B}\approx 2200\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, consistent with $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ for the Pleiades, or Hyades/Praesepe within uncertainties.

\subsection{Flaring luminosity $FA$}

We can relate the luminosity in flares in the Kepler band to the quiescent bolometric luminosity of the star, and by this define the fractional flare luminosity $FA$ (similar to \citetalias{ilin2019}):
\begin{align}
\label{eq:FA}
FA&=\dfrac{E_\mathrm{Kp,flare,tot,}}{t\cdot L_{\mathrm{bol,*,}}}
\end{align}
We determined $L_\mathrm{bol,*}$ from $R_*$ and $T_\mathrm{eff}$, as described in Sec.~\ref{TeffRL}. The energy released in flares was inferred using our derived stellar luminosities. It declines with age for every $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bin considered for both the total luminosity and relative to the quiescent flux~(Fig. \ref{fig:FA}). However, we found that $FA$ remained high ($>10^{-5}$) in early to mid M dwarfs for several hundred Myr after Pleiades age.

We used the shared energy threshold (\input{values/FA_energy_thesh.txt}\unskip) that we determined for the full FFD in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ in Fig. \ref{fig:powerlawfit_full} to calculate $FA$ using Eq. \ref{eq:FA}. $FA$ is a meaningful measure of relative stellar activity as long as the flux portion of the quiescent star in the Kepler band is roughly constant. It is therefore more meaningful to compare $FA$ across age than across $T_\mathrm{eff}$.}}

\subsection{Hyades and Praesepe: Rotating differently}
We expected the flaring activity in the Hyades and Praesepe to be very similar because they were nearly coeval clusters with ages around 700 Myr, and comparable metallicities ([Fe/H](Praesepe)\,$=0.16$, [Fe/H](Hyades)\,$=0.13$,~\citealt{netopil_metallicities_2016}). We found this reflected in all our FFDs, except for the $3500-3750$\,K temperature bin, where the Hyades appeared almost as active as the Pleiades (135 Myr). This discrepancy could be explained by the rotation period distributions of their samples. In all other temperature bins the rotation period distributions of the Hyades and Praesepe were similar, while the Pleiades showed shorter periods on average. In the $3500-3750$\,K temperature bin, the rotation periods found in the Hyades and the Pleiades were more alike than in the Hyades and Praesepe (see Fig. \ref{fig:rotation_histogram} in the Appendix). In this temperature regime, the majority of Praesepe stars had rotation periods above 10\,d, while in the Hyades and the Pleiades rotation periods were more evenly distibuted in the $0.3-30$\,d range.

%-------------------------------------------
We found several flare candidates in members of M67 and Rup 147. But upon close inspection all but the events that occurred on four stars either turned out to be false positives, or occurred on multiple systems or evolved stars. Most flare candidates in these old clusters were detected on RS CVn binaries, cataclysmic binaries, Algol type binaries, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and red giant stars. Excluding all these, we were left with one flare in M67 on an early K dwarf. In Rup~147, we narrowed down the list to a flare on a G8 star in Rup~147, and four flares each on a K0.5 and an M3 star. For these stars, the multiplicity status was unknown. The uncertainty about the stellar properties suggests a range of possible masses of the system. \textbf{The mass budget could be calculated from the uncertainties on their radii $R_*$ using the relations from \citet{eker2018}. In all cases, it was large enough that the stars in question could in principle be binary stars with undetected mid-M dwarf companions. We calculated hypothetic binary pairs for the cases where the primary mass was the smallest possible within $1\sigma$ on $R_*$. We give the median spectral type of the target if it was a single star, and the spectral types of the hypothetic binaries in Table~\ref{tab:m67_rup147_binaries}.}
\\
After the manual inspection of the younger clusters we concluded that, while binaries and false positives were present in these clusters also, they were not the dominating source of flares. As multiplicity rates for low-mass stars decrease from about 50\% for F type stars~\citep{raghavan2010} to 22\% for L and T dwarfs~\citep{duchene2013}, with M dwarfs showing somewhat higher multiplicity rates at about 27\%~\citep{winters2019}, we expect that the error introduced by unresolved binaries on our results was smaller for the cooler $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%-------------------------------------------
The launch of the Kepler satellite in 2009 caused a surge in statistical flare studies, a trend that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will continue and expand. Comparing our results with these works~\citep{shibayama2013,lurie2015,lin2019,raetz2020} and recent ground based surveys~\citep{chang2015,howard2019} we found encouraging consistency but also some noteworthy discrepancies that we could not always trace back to its cause. We discuss the disagreement between our FFDs and a gyrochronological model recently proposed for its parametrization as a function of mass and age~\citep{davenport2019}. We conclude the discussion with a reflection on the universality of the power law exponent $\alpha$, and the observational limitations of the representation of FFDs by power law distributions.

Red stars indicate flares found in the short cadence light curves, grey diamonds are flares from the long cadence time series. There are no exactly matching events in the FFD although a subset of the short cadence flares was detected in long cadence also. This has two reasons. First, in long cadence, flare energy is typically underestimated~\citep{yang_flaresampling_2018}. Second, smaller flares are merged together if they occur within a sufficently short time period. What looks like one flare in long cadence is sometimes resolved into two or more flares in short cadence}.}          
    \label{fig:shortlong}
\end{figure}
%---------------------------------------------
We found our results to be broadly consistent with previous work both on Kepler/K2 data, and ground based surveys in the optical regime, with some noteable exceptions~(Fig. \ref{fig:otherwork}). Overall we believe that the differences between individual results were rooted in a combination of astrophysical properties like age, mass, rotation speed, and the influence of selection criteria on the respective samples. 
\\
\textbf{The flare frequency distributions of two fast rotating (0.26 and 0.71 days) M5 flare stars in a M5-M5-M8 triple system~\citep{lurie2015} were consistent with the FFDs of flares in the Pleiades, Praesepe, and Hyades in the $3000-3250\,$K bin. We also found that the FFDs of nearby K and M dwarfs, observed by Kepler/K2 within 200pc and 100pc, respectively, fell in the range between the Pleiades and Hyades/Praesepe FFDs in our sample~\citep{lin2019}.
\\
The frequency of superflares at $10^{34}$ erg in the most active G-dwarfs and Sun-like stars in Kepler was once in 10–100 days, and every 440 years on average solar-type stars~\citep{shibayama2013}. Benchmarking on the flare detected on a K1 dwarf in M67 in the G to early K bin (5000-6000 K), and accounting for the fraction of the total flare energy that the Kepler passband covers at a flare temperature of 10 000 K, we found the flaring rate at this energy to amount to about once every 100 years. Doing the same for the Pleiades stars yielded that ZAMS G to K dwarfs flare once per year at $10^{34}$ erg. Our young G-K stars therefore were less active than the active G dwarfs in \citet{shibayama2013}, while our solar-age G-K dwarfs appeared more active than in their results.
\\
\citet{howard2019} monitored superflares on cool stars with bolometric energies above $10^{33}$ erg and up to $10^{36}$erg. They found power law exponents $\sim 2$ in FFDs resolved by spectral type. The activity levels for spectral types K5 to M4 were on average higher than in our sample. However, \citet{howard2019} only included stars that exhibited flares (active stars) into their FFDs, whereas we also accounted for the observing time of stars where no flares had been detected.} 
\\
Photometric flares observed by the MMT 6.5 telescope~\citep{hartman2008} in the $\sim550$ Myr old open cluster M37~\citep{chang2015} appeared on average more active than the Pleiades in our study for spectral types M0-M6. This could imply that flaring activity in these low-mass stars peaked not at Pleiades age but at a later evolutionary stage. \citet{mondrik2019} found evidence of increased flaring activity at intermediate rotation rates between fast and slow sequence~\citep{barnes_rotational_2003}. This finding could not be reproduced in the data obtained from the all-sky EvryFlare survey~\citep{howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}. We found $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ to decrease with age from ZAMS to 700\,Myr for all stars except those with spectral types later than M5~(Fig. \ref{fig:beta_T_age}). But this does not exclude that $\beta_\mathrm{s}$ in fact increased between these two ages before decreasing relatively rapidly within a short period of time.
\\
\textbf{Similarly, \citet{raetz2020} pointed out that their fast rotating M1.5-M4.5 dwarfs appeared more active than the results for the Pleiades in \citetalias{ilin2019} in the $3250-3750\,$K range. Our revised results remained consistent with \citetalias{ilin2019}~(Fig. \ref{fig:otherwork}). For comparison, we used our method to search a star that both studies investigated for flares. In Fig.~\ref{fig:shortlong}, we demonstrate that short cadence light curves used in~\citet{raetz2020}, and long cadence light curves studied here yielded consistent FFDs. Both samples were comprised of flares with periods below 10\,d. Rotation periods $P_\mathrm{rot}$ were given for 100\% of the sample in~\cite{raetz2020}, and for \mbox{$>85\%$} in our Pleiades sub-sample~(see Fig. \ref{fig:rotation_histogram} in the Appendix for the distribution of $P_\mathrm{rot}$). We note three plausible reasons for the discrepancy here. First, the M1.5-M4.5 dwarfs in \citet{raetz2020} could be stars at a an age at which the stars show higher flaring activity than stars with the same rotation periods in the Pleiades. Second, there may be selection effects in the short cadence sample in \citet{raetz2020} as compared to our sample. Targets for short cadence observations in K2 were not selected randomly from the underlying stellar population, but were filtered for a variety of properties that biased the final selection towards more active stars. Third, our $3250-3750\,$K corresponds rather to spectral types M1-M3.5 than to M1.5-M4.5~\citep{pecaut_intrinsic_2013}. So the $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins chosen in~\citet{raetz2020} encompassed later, and therefore more active, spectral types. Eventually, a resolution of this discrepancy must also take into account that the results for our Praesepe sample in the  $3250-3750\,$K range were consistent with the slow rotators ($P_\mathrm{rot}\sim32\,$d) in \citet{raetz2020}.}
\subsection{Gyrochronological FFD parametrization}
\label{sec:davenport}
\citet{davenport2019} derived a parametrization of FFD parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as a function of mass and age using the Kepler flare catalog~\citep{davenport_kepler_2016}, rotation periods from~\citet{mcquillan2014}, and the \citet{mamajek2008} gyrochrone model. \textbf{We show the model power laws in Fig. \ref{fig:powerlawfits_erg} alongside our results. The activity level in our sample appeared much lower than predicted by the model. A deviation was expected as the model was not designed to predict absolute ages. The authors noted a sample bias in their study towards more active stars. As discussed by the authors, their model overpredicted the superflaring rate of the average Sun-like sample from~\citet{shibayama2013} and more resembled the rate for their most active sub-sample. With our data we could quantify the overestimation to be one to two orders of magnitude. Our results also suggest that the model overpredicts the activity level for old stars more than for younger stars}~(Fig. \ref{fig:powerlawfits_erg}).
\subsection{Universality of $\alpha$}
Taking into account uncertainties and systematic errors resulting from the use of different power law fitting methods~\citep{maschberger2009}, the power law exponent $\alpha\sim 2$ appeared to be similar for the majority of studies on flare statistics in the literature so far, irrespective of spectral type or age. The values derived for $\alpha$ in our sample were close to $2$ in $ED$ space, and $\sim 2.1$ in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$, consistent with previous work~(Fig. \ref{fig:app:powerlaw_literature} in the Appendix). The determination of $\alpha$ usually faces methodological challenges that make it difficult to assess whether the spread in $\alpha$ from about $1.4$ to $2.5$ is physically motivated or not. 
\\
For both low and high energies, the detection of flares was incomplete. At the low-energy end the detection probability depended on flare duration and amplitude. These parameters were not resolved in FFDs, and while they were correletad there is significant spread in the duration-amplitude relation to blur the cutoff in the FFD. One way to account for this circumstance is to inject and recover large numbers of synthetic flares with a variety of durations and amplitudes and to determine energy ratios and recovery probabilities for each flare candidate, assuming that the underlying flare shape can be sufficiently well parametrized. This was first explored in~\citet{davenport_kepler_2014} for Kepler data and expanded in~(Schmidt et al., in prep.) for TESS. However, GP regression, which was used to de-trend the light curves, was too costly to be repeated hundreds of times for each light curve. 
\\
At the high energy end, the incompleteness is most likely to occur in the full sample FFDs where we expect either observational or physical maximum energy thresholds to be reached for certain spectral types and ages. 
\\
These effects may be partly cancelled by background contamination from, for instance, cosmic rays~\citep{aschwanden_powerlaws_2015}, or solar system objects (SSO). We were also limited by the non-linear dependence for the energy bias from time sampling effects that lead to the severe underestimation of flares energies, as can be observed by comparing flare energies derived for the same flare events from short and long cadence light curves~\citep{yang_flaresampling_2018}. As long as these caveats apply, the question about the universal nature of $\alpha$ cannot be settled.
\subsection{Deviations from single power law}
%\citet{namekata_solarstellarwlf_2017} found conceivable that spots evolve on timescale shorter than the estimated lifetimes. 
Spots can survive on the stellar surface from a few days to nearly a year~
\citep{namekata_solarstellarwlf_2017, davenport_flaresandspots_2015}. Complex spot geometry is correlated with the stongest X-class flares on the Sun~\citep{toriumi_flaresspotssun_2017, sammis_deltaspotsflares_2000}. These observations support the idea that flares are associated with the presence of certain types of starspots, or more generally, certain types of active regions. Since we expect that there is a maximum flare energy a spot can produce, the underlying power law relation must break a some $ED_\mathrm{max}$ in any FFD. We tested a possible truncation of our FFDs using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for consistency with a power law distribution, followed by the exceedance statistic to test for a truncation of this power law as suggested by~\citet{maschberger2009}. While most FFDs with $\geqslant50$ flares were consistent with a power law distribution, we found no evidence for truncation in any of the $T_\mathrm{eff}$-age bins. This would imply that we did not sample the highest possible energies. Such a conclusion is plausible because much higher relative fluxes than our observed maximum flare amplitudes were detected on other stars~\citep{paudel_monsterucdflare_2018, jackman_superflareucd_2019, schmidt2016}.
\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
In this study, we investigated how flaring activity unfolded for different age and $T_\mathrm{eff}$ ranges anchoring the age to the membership in five open clusters. We found flaring activity to decrease from ZAMS to solar age, and from mid M dwarfs to G stars, except for stars later than M5, where activity increased from ZAMS to 690\,Myr.
\\
Using multiple cluster membership studies we selected for high-probability members, and drew from a host of multiband photometry catalogs to determine $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and stellar luminosities. Keeping only targets with well-determined mass and age we proceeded to search \input{values/total_number_of_lcs.txt}K2 long cadence light curves obtained for these stars throughout the K2 mission. We applied the open source software \texttt{K2SC} to remove rotational variability and instrumental effects, and \texttt{AltaiPony} to automatically detect and determine the properties of flare candidates. We vetted all flare candidates manually and discussed various sources of false positives and incompleteness on both the high and the low energy end of the FFDs. We searched \input{values/total_number_of_stars.txt}stars in five open clusters, and found a total of \input{values/total_number_of_flares.txt}flares. Most flares originated in the Pleiades and Praesepe, several hundred were found in the Hyades, a handful in Rup 147, and only one flare candidate appeared on a K1 dwarf in M67.
\\
While the FFDs appeared to follow power law distributions, we found no sign of truncation at the high energy end. The power law exponent $\alpha$ was consistent with previous work, and we caution against interpreting apparent trends, especially when comparing across different studies.
\\
We noticed that our results showed lower activity than predicted by a gyrochronological FFD parametrization as a function of mass and age~\citep{davenport2019}, and that the model did not always match the differential decline in age within individual $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins. Although some discrepancies in flaring activity between Praesepe and the Hyades could be traced back to their rotation period distributions, the relation between flaring, rotation, and age awaits further investigation.
\\
Regardless of varying methods employed for flare search and FFD analysis in previous studies we found encouraging consistency in flaring rates with both Kepler and K2 based work, and ground-based surveys. We noticed some differences, which we could not always resolve as being either systematic or astrophysical. We suggest that discrepancies between our results and flare studies that used rotation periods for their age estimates~\citep{davenport2019, raetz2020} could be explained by sample selection bias but may also point to limitations of rotation periods as an age indicator.
\\
Results from the first year of operations of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~\citep{ricker2014} indicate that the light curve quality delivered by the mission so far was well suited for statistical flare studies~\citep{doyle2020,guenther2020}. The expected lifetime of the mission could be up to 20 years, in which case the number of high quality flare samples will soon outclass Kepler and K2 as the primary source of flares. Not only will the mission vastly expand the treasury of light curves, help us address open questions noted in this work and other statistical flares studies, and pave the road to the use of flaring activity as an age indicator. It will also allow us to probe the flaring activity of the lowest mass dwarfs down into the brown dwarf regime, a realm that could only be scratched by Kepler and K2~\citep{gizis2013, paudel2018}, and remains mostly inaccessible from the ground.

p(BM(\text{binary member}))&=&0.9,\\
p(N (\text{non-member}))&=&0.1,\\
p(SN(\text{single non-member}))&=&0.1,\\
p(BN (\text{binary non-member}))&=&0.1,\\
p(U (\text{unknown member}))&=&0.5.
\end{eqnarray*}
In~\citet{curtis_ruprecht_2013}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p(Y (\text{highest confidence member}))=0.9,\\
p(P (\text{possible/probable member}))=0.7,\\
p(N (\text{not likely/non-member}))=0.7,\\
p(B (\text{photometry consistent with blue stragglers}))=0.0.\\
\end{eqnarray*}
In~\citet{rebull_praesepe_2017}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p((\text{best}))=0.9,\\
p((\text{ok}))=0.6,\\
p((\text{else}))=0.1.
\end{eqnarray*}
Members from \citet{rebull_rotation_2016, douglas_poking_2017}; and ~\citet{gaia_dr2_2018_hrd} were assigned $p=0.9$ if they appeared in the final catalog.

\section{Cluster parameters}
\label{app:cluster_params}
We compiled various age, distance, and metallicity values from the literature for the clusters in this study. Table \ref{tab:app:oc_parameters} shows that most studies independently arrived at similar results for all our clusters. The adopted parameters are emphasized, and were chosen based on consistency with prior work, uncertainties provided with the results and the data used for the study (newer catalogs were preferred).

\section{Broadband photometry: quality cuts and conversions}
\label{app:photometry}
We required \texttt{flux}/\texttt{flux\_error} $\geq 10$ for Gaia $G$, $BP$, and $RP$ bands. We require that the 2MASS measurements for $J$, $H$, and $K$ to be "A". "A" meant that measurements had $S/N>10$ and $\sigma<0.11$. For PanSTARRS photometry, we required that the \texttt{QF\_OBJ\_GOOD} quality filter flag was set. %We required flags 8 or 16 or 32 in the \texttt{gFlags}~(and respective flags for r,i,z, and y) from \texttt{ObjectFilterFlags} to be set for each band. 8 indicates that observation were made on a photometric night. 16 and 32 verify that PS1 photometry was obtained.
SDSS and PS1 \textit{ugrizy} bands were similar but not identical, but could be converted using Table 2 in~\citet{finkbeiner_ps1tosdss_2016}.

\textbf{\section{Solar System Object detection with SkyBot}
\label{app:skybot}
The K2 photometry was heavily affected by crossings of Solar System Objects (SSO), which consequently produced mimicking flare profiles in the light curves~\citep{szabo2015}. Independently, two of us visually verified the SSO-nature of 42 flaring light curve events by inspecting their corresponding TargetPixelFiles (TPF) using \texttt{lightkurve}~\citep{lightkurve2018}. Except for one occasion, we found all events to be known SSOs, both in the visual survey and automatically using SkyBot~\citep{berthier2016}. Subsequently, we ran SkyBot on the remaining catalog of flares to remove other false positive events caused by known SSOs. Visual inspections of TPFs were carried out for any SSO detected within 30'' of its target star at mid-event time. This yielded additional 103 contaminated signals distributed among three subgroups, (i) 77 unambiguous SSO-contaminants verified through \texttt{lightkurve} (ii) 18 faint SkyBot-detections ($V\approx 20.4-23.8$) within $\sim3$ pixels from the respective target star but visually unresolvable in the TPF, (iii) 8 occurrences in which both flare and SSO-crossing occurred during the given flare duration stated in the catalog. The latter should be dealt with caution due to a high risk of inaccurate catalog information altered by the presence of SSOs. Despite of discarding a total of 144 flare events, we expect additional contaminants by unknown SSOs to hide in the current sample. This issue can partly be resolved by animating each TPF as demonstrated by Kristiansen et al. (in prep.). }
\section{Modified Maximum Likelihood Estimatator}
\label{sec:app:MMLE}
As a means to arrive at results efficiently, and as consistency check to the method derived from~\citet{wheatland_flaresbayes_2004} we fitted $\alpha$ to the FFDs in $ED$ and $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ space using a Modified Maximum Likelihood Estimatator (MMLE,~ \citealt{maschberger2009}). The logarithm of the likelihood function $\mathcal{L}$ that had to be maximized was given by the authors in Eq. (8) in their manuscript:
\begin{equation}
\log \mathcal{L} = n \log (1-\hat{\alpha})-n \log\left(x_\mathrm{max}^{1-\hat{\alpha}}-x_\mathrm{min}^{1-\hat{\alpha}}\right) - \hat{\alpha} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log x_i
\label{eqn:MLE}
\end{equation}
where $x_i$, $x_\mathrm{max}$, and $x_\mathrm{min}$ were the detected flare energies, and the upper and lower limits for detection, respectively. $n$ was the total number of flares. The estimate for $\alpha$ would be biased in practice because the value used for $x_\mathrm{max}$ would be the maximum energy that was measured, and not the underlying upper limit. The stabilization transformation suggested by the authors (Eq. (12) in \citealt{maschberger2009}) was then applied to the solution for $\alpha$ to account for this bias:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = 1 + \dfrac{n}{n-2}(\hat{\alpha} - 1)
\label{eqn:MLE_stabilize}
\end{equation}
Using the MMLE method on the full sample of flares in $E_\mathrm{Kp}$ and $ED$ space we obtained $\alpha_\mathrm{erg}=$\input{values/mmle_alpha_energy.txt}\unskip and $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=$\input{values/mmle_alpha_ed.txt}, respectively, indicating a marginally flatter power law than the predictive model ($\alpha_\mathrm{erg}=$\input{values/MCMC_alpha_energy.txt}, $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=$\input{values/MCMC_alpha_ed.txt}).
 %As recommended by \citet{maschberger2009}, we applied the stabilized Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test at $95\,\%$ significance level to all power law fits in the sample. If the test fails the power law model does not fit the data at the given significance level. If the test passes, this does not give any information whether the power law model is the correct assumption. The goodness of fit can be estimated from the visual inspection of percentile-percentile plots, given in the online material\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ekaterinailin/flares-in-clusters-with-k2-ii}}.

         \caption{Rotation histograms for the cluster members that were searched for flares and had measured rotation periods $P_\mathrm{rot}$. Rotation periods were taken from~\citet{douglas2019} for the Hyades (orange solid) and Praesepe (yellow dashed), and from~\citet{rebull_pleiadesrot_2016} for the Pleiades (maroon dotted). Rotation periods were available for $\input{values/min_stars_with_rotation_periods.txt}-\input{values/max_stars_with_rotation_periods.txt}\%$ of the stars that we searched for flares with a median of $\input{values/median_stars_with_rotation_periods.txt}\%$.}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
More energetic flares can be expected from faster rotating stars~\citep{candelaresi_superflare_2014, doorsselaere_stellar_2017, yang_flaring_2017}. However, the famous $~\mathrm{age}^{-1/2}$ Skumanich spin-down law for rotation braking and Ca II depletion as a proxy to magnetic activity~\citep{skumanich1972} was only ever true to a first approximation.
%Findings that flares with intermediate Rossby number appear to flare more than fast and slow rotators~\citep{mondrik_flarerotation_2019} \textbf{could not be reproduced here} or in the EvryFlare survey~\citep{howard_evryflare2arxiv_2019}. 
%If enhanced flaring can be interpreted as an increase in the stellar angular momentum loss rate flaring activity can be used to inform the cause of variation in the spin-down efficiency. 
One example of non-linear spin-down was the apparent temporary stalling of spin-down seen in K dwarfs in the 1\,Gyr old open cluster NGC 6811~\citep{curtis2019}. As our results indicate, the decline of flaring activity with age did not follow the Skumanich law across the stellar main sequence life time. Moreover, it depended crucially on $T_\mathrm{eff}$~(see Fig. \ref{fig:beta_T_age}). 
% The authors favored a scenario in which the stellar core transfers momentum onto the envelope but did not rule out the possibility of a decreased magnetic braking efficiency. In the latter scenario, these stars should flare less. %What do Cecilia's models say about the change in MF regime in these stars?
\\
In Fig. \ref{fig:rotation_histogram} we show rotation periods derived from K2 light curves for the Pleiades~\citep{rebull_pleiadesrot_2016}, the Hyades and Praesepe~\citep{douglas2019}, to illustrate the $P_\mathrm{rot}$ distributions that correspond to our $T_\mathrm{eff}$ bins.
\section{Universality of $\alpha$}
\label{sec:app:universal_alpha}
We searched the literature for studies where power laws were fitted to FFDs of flares in the optical regime using different methods~(see Fig.~\ref{fig:app:powerlaw_literature} for a comparison). While most studies consistently find values somewhat above or below $\alpha\approx2$, the comparison would reveal unresolved systematic errors in all these studies, including our own, if $\alpha$ was truly universal for all FFDs.

         \caption{Literature overview over power law fits to FFDs. Red rectangles indicate the energy range in which flares were detected (height), and the range of values determined for the power law exponent $\alpha$~(width) including quoted uncertainties and superimposing the ranges for $\alpha$ from multiple FFDs if any. The references are attached to the upper or lower left corner of the respective rectangle. The grey rectangle refers to this study. The grey line depicts the superposition of these results, representing each by a Gaussian fit with the range used as standard deviation, and weighted by the square root of the number of flares found in each study. \citetalias{ilin2019} is shown with a dark outline. \citet{lacy_uv_1976} pioneered in statistical flare studies using observations of eight UV Ceti stars. \citet{shakhovskaya_stellar_1989} analyzed monitoring data from several dozen active early K to late M dwarfs in the solar vicinity, the Orion, the Pleiades, the Hyades, and the Praesepe cluster. \citet{hawley_kepler_2014} used flares from M dwarfs in the original Kepler observations for their FFDs. A number of studies focused on solar-type and G dwarfs stars in Kepler~\citep{maehara2012,wu2015,shibayama2013}. \citet{hilton2011} derived $\alpha$ from ground-based observations of M dwarfs. \citet{lurie2015} determined $\alpha$ from Kepler short cadence light curves of two active M5 dwarfs in Kepler. \citet{davenport_kepler_2016} searched the entire Kepler catalog for flares. \citet{yang_flaring_2017} followed up on \citet{davenport_kepler_2016} in searching the entire Kepler catalog for flares. \citet{lin2019} (M) and (K) were based on nearby M and K dwarf flares in K2 long cadence light curves. \citep{raetz2020} studied short cadence M dwarfs with rotation periods in K2. \citet{gizis_k2_2017-1} constructed an FFD for 22 flares on an M7 dwarf. \citet{paudel2018} studied M6-L0 dwarfs in K2 short cadence data. \citet{howard2019} found over 500 superflares on 284 stars in the framework of the Evryscope all-sky survey. Photometric flares were observed by the MMT 6.5 telescope~\citep{hartman2008} in the $\sim550$ Myr old M37 open cluster~\citep{chang2015}. Finally, \citep{guenther2020} took a first look to $\alpha$ as derived from stars observed during TESS Cycle 1. From their work we only use $\alpha$ derived from stars with 20 or more flare detections.
