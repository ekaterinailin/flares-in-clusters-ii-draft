## Membership probabilities

- write about membership
- refer to table B1

## Stellar Parameters

- cross-matching using topcat Gaia@AIP and Gaia Archive
- include plots in main paper
- what CTRs did we use

- write about StarHorse
- extinction: If not available for a target use the mean of the cluster
- extinction for M67, M35 and Ruprecht 147, Gaia Apsis extinction for Bp and Rp

- ('g_SDSS','J_2MASS'), ('BP_Gaia','RP_Gaia'), ('g_SDSS','z_SDSS'),
                       ('g_SDSS','i_SDSS'), ('g_SDSS','H_2MASS'), ('g_SDSS','K_2MASS'),
                       ('r_SDSS','z_SDSS'), ('r_SDSS','J_2MASS') for CMDs
- write about weighted mean
- 211 specmatch emp no, library yes, what sources does it contain
- write about SJS model spectra for M and L dwarfs

- We determined stellar radii using Mann et al. (2015) Erratum Table 1 relations between Teff and R for Teff below 3500 K and interpolated in the empirical library compiled by Yee at al. (2017) above 3500 K
